# Chapter 1

## **CHAPTER 1**

Edinburgh’s High Street stank of piss and philosophy. A fishwife’s shout cut through a student’s earnest declamation on moral sense; herring scales glittered on the cobbles like discarded syllogisms. In the close mouth, a man in a threadbare coat felt for the shilling in his pocket, its weight both a universal truth and a purely local despair.



“That’s you, then,” a voice said at his elbow.

He didn’t turn. He knew the smell of Old Spice and damp wool. Archie. “Is it?”

“Aye. Funeral’s the morn. Two o’clock at the Eastern Necropolis. Humanist service. She specified.” Archie slid into the booth opposite, his bulk making the worn vinyl sigh. He placed his own pint down with a soft *thock*. “You’re going.”

It wasn’t a question. Donnie finally looked at him. Archie’s face was a roadmap of Glasgow life—broken nose from a long-forgotten game of fitba, laugh lines etched deep from a thousand bad jokes in worse pubs, but his eyes, now, were flat. Tired.

“I’m not,” Donnie said.

“You are. She was your auntie, Donnie.”

“She was my mother’s sister who I saw twice a decade. Once at a wedding, once at a hospital. She didn’t like me.”

“She didn’t like anybody. That’s not the point. The point is decency. And the fact she’s left you the flat.”

The word hung in the air between them, heavier than the pub’s smoke-stained ceiling. The *Clansman* didn’t allow smoking anymore, not for ten years, but the ghost of a million Regal King Size clung to the velour and the dark wood.

“The flat,” Donnie repeated, his voice hollow.

“Top floor, 14 Dalriada Street. Two rooms, kitchenette, bathroom you could swing a cat in if you didn’t like the cat. But it’s hers. Was hers. Mortgage paid off in ’92. It’s yours.”

Donnie took a long, slow pull from his pint. The beer was cold and bitter. He felt a strange, detached curiosity. “Why?”

“Because your mother’s gone, your da’s in Spain with that woman from the bingo, and you’re… here.” Archie gestured vaguely, taking in the pub, the rain, the whole of the East End. “She thought you might need a leg up. Or a roof. Same thing, sometimes.”

“I’ve got a roof.”

“A rented room in a shared flat in Govan with a leak over your bed and a landlord who thinks ‘repairs’ is a swear word. That’s not a roof, son. That’s a condemnation notice with the date left blank.”

Donnie didn’t argue. It was true. He worked nights driving a delivery van for a bakery, hauling morning rolls and potato scones to corner shops from Bridgeton to Bishopbriggs. He slept in the day, when he could. His life was a series of damp streets seen through a windscreen wiper’s arc, the smell of yeast and flour, and the endless, low hum of solitude. He was thirty-eight. The flat in Govan was a place to store his clothes and sleep. It wasn’t a home. He’d forgotten what that felt like.

“The key,” Archie said, and slid a single Yale key across the table. It had a small, green fob shaped like a thistle. Cheap. “Go and see it. After the funeral. Or before. But you’re going to the funeral.”

Donnie picked up the key. It was cold. “Humanist, you said?”

“Aye. No hymns. Just some words. Probably a poem. Maybe a bit of Burns she didn’t think was sentimental pish. Then back to the *Clansman* for pies and pints. Her instructions. She planned it.”

“Of course she did.” Aunt Morag had been a force of nature, all sharp edges and sharper tongue. She’d worked as a clerk in the Sheriff Court for forty years, and had treated her home life with the same brisk, unsentimental efficiency. Donnie remembered her at his mother’s funeral, a stiff, black-clad figure who hadn’t cried, but whose hand on his shoulder had felt like a bolt of iron, holding him upright.

He pocketed the key. It felt like it was burning a hole in his jeans.

*

The rain had eased to a drizzle by the time he got off the bus on the Gallowgate, the key a hard presence in his pocket. Dalriada Street was a short, steep lane off the main drag, a canyon of four-storey sandstone tenements. The buildings had known grandeur once, with their bay windows and stone flourishes, but time and the city’s breath had worn them down. Curtains were drawn against the gloom. A single bin, overturned, spilled orange peel and a milk carton onto the pavement.

Number 14. The close mouth was a dark rectangle. The original door was long gone, replaced by a heavy, scarred thing of chipboard and peeling blue paint. Donnie pushed it open.

The smell hit him first. Damp, yes, but underneath it, the particular scent of old tenements: a century of cooking fat embedded in plaster, coal dust in the pores of the stone, a hint of lavender polish. The close was narrow, the floor a mosaic of cracked tiles, black and white, now a uniform grey with grime. A single bulb, caged in wire, lit the stairwell. It cast long, dramatic shadows up the stairs, which curved away into darkness.

He started to climb. The stone steps were worn into shallow dips in the middle, concave from generations of feet. The banister was cool and smooth under his hand. On the first landing, two doors faced each other. From behind one, a television blared a game show. On the second landing, silence. The third landing was the top. The air was colder here, and the smell of damp was stronger, mixed with something else—old paper, maybe, and dust.

The door to flat 3/2 was painted a dark, glossy green. The brass letterbox was tarnished. He fitted the key into the lock. It turned with a solid, well-oiled *clunk* that surprised him. He’d expected resistance.

He pushed the door open and stepped into the dark.

He fumbled for a light switch, found it. A bare bulb in a rose fixture in the ceiling flickered on, illuminating the room.

It was a kitchen. Or the main room served as a kitchen. A small sink under the window, a two-ring electric hob on a cupboard unit, a freestanding wardrobe with one door hanging askew. A table, one chair. A single bed against the far wall, made with military precision, a rough wool blanket pulled taut. It was stark. Austere. And it was immaculately, terrifyingly clean. Not a speck of dust. The linoleum floor, a faded pattern of brown and orange squares, gleamed. The window, looking out over the backs of other tenements and a sliver of the city skyline, was spotless.

This was Aunt Morag’s world. Ordered. Contained. Unforgiving.

Donnie moved further in, his footsteps loud in the silence. He opened the wardrobe. Three dresses, all dark, all wool. A single pair of sensible shoes. A winter coat. On a shelf above, a small cardboard box. He took it down.

Inside, photographs. Not many. His mother, young, laughing, an arm around a scowling Morag at what looked like a seaside resort. A man in a uniform—his grandfather, maybe. And one of Donnie himself, aged about seven, standing stiffly in a school uniform, his hair slicked down. He looked bewildered. He put the photos back.

The other room was the bathroom, tiny, a geyser on the wall above the bath. The towels on the rail were thin, grey, but clean.

He went back to the main room and sat on the one chair. The silence was absolute. He could hear the distant thrum of the city, a bus changing gear on the Gallowgate, a dog barking somewhere. But here, in this clean, cold box at the top of the world, there was nothing. No life. Just the ghost of a rigid, disciplined woman.

He should feel something, he thought. Grief, or nostalgia, or even relief at the prospect of a place of his own. But all he felt was a profound emptiness, seeping into him from the very walls. This wasn’t a legacy. It was a specimen jar. A perfectly preserved example of a life stripped bare of everything but necessity.

His eyes fell on the bed again. There, on the pillow, was a single sheet of paper, folded in half. He hadn’t noticed it before.

He got up, crossed the room, and picked it up. It was good quality paper, crisp. In Aunt Morag’s precise, spidery handwriting, it read:

*Donald,*

*The rent book is in the top drawer. Rates are paid to the end of the quarter. The immersion heater switch is behind the bathroom door. It takes forty minutes. Don’t waste the electricity.*

*There is a leak in the ceiling above the sink. It comes from the attic space. I spoke to the factor, MacLeod, three times. He did nothing. A man who does nothing is a man who steals your time, and time is all we have. See to it.*

*Do not let the place go to ruin. It is not much, but it is solid. The walls are thick.*

*Morag.*

He read it twice. The instructions, the reproach about the factor, the stark philosophy. *Time is all we have.* And that final, cryptic line. *The walls are thick.*

He looked up at the ceiling. Above the sink, sure enough, was a dark, yellowing stain, a bloom of damp in the shape of a continent. A slow, persistent leak.

A sudden, fierce anger rose in him, hot and surprising. At the leak, at the factor, at Morag for leaving him this problem, this empty cell with its one, defiant flaw. At the sheer, unyielding *meanness* of it all—the room, the rain, the life waiting for him downstairs.

He crumpled the note in his fist. Then, slowly, he smoothed it out again, folded it neatly, and put it in his pocket.

He was going to have to see to it.

# Chapter 2

## **CHAPTER 2**

The humanist celebrant had a kind face and a voice that tried too hard to be soothing. It echoed in the small, non-denominational chapel of the crematorium, bouncing off the beige walls and the too-shiny floor. There were seventeen people. Donnie counted. Archie and his wife, Cathy. Four elderly women from Morag’s old work, their faces set in identical masks of grim propriety. A few neighbours from Dalriada Street, including a man with a spectacular comb-over who kept checking his watch. And Donnie, sitting in the front row, feeling like an imposter.

“Morag McCallum was a woman of principle,” the celebrant was saying. “She valued order, clarity, and directness. She had little time for pretense, and even less for sentimentality.”

*Aye, you got that right*, Donnie thought. He stared at the simple oak coffin on the catafalque. It seemed too small to contain all that sharpness.

The service was short. A reading of a poem by Norman MacCaig about a sparrow, which seemed an odd choice for Morag, who’d once called pigeons “flying rats.” A few words from one of the work women about her reliability. Then it was over. The curtains slid shut with a soft whirr, and that was that. Morag was gone, on her way to become a neat pile of ashes in a green plastic tub.

Back at the *Clansman*, the mood was brighter. The pies were hot, the pints were flowing, and the stories started.

“Remember the time,” Archie was saying, a fleck of pastry on his chin, “when young Dougie from number 16 let his football go through her close window? Cost him a tenner, and that was in 1978! She made him come up and collect the ball, and she inspected it for damage first.”

The work women cackled. “She once made a sheriff’s clerk re-type an entire summons because he used two spaces after a full stop instead of one. Said it was ‘typographical sloppiness bordering on the criminal.’”

Donnie nursed his pint, listening. This was a Morag he didn’t know. Not a relative, but a local monument. A fixed point in the universe of the Gallowgate. Her stubbornness, her rules, her sharp tongue—they were landmarks. They made sense here, in the warm, noisy pub, surrounded by the living. In the silent flat, they’d just been bleak.

Cathy, Archie’s wife, a small woman with eyes that missed nothing, sidled up to him. “You’ll be moving into the flat, then?”

“Thinking about it.”

“It’s a good flat. Solid. Morag kept it like a palace. A very… strict palace.” She sipped her gin. “She was worried about that leak, you know. In a right state about it the last month. Said it was getting worse. Said the factor was a useless article.”

“So I gathered.”

“Aye, well, MacLeod’s a charmless sod. But it’s not his attic, see. It’s the whole building’s. The roof’s a shared responsibility. Getting four households to agree to pay for a roofer is like herding cats. Drunk cats.” She patted his arm. “You’ll need to be a diplomat, Donnie. Or a dictator. Morag tried the latter. Didn’t work.”

Later, with the grey afternoon light fading into a drizzly evening, Donnie found himself back at the mouth of the close on Dalriada Street. He had a duffel bag with some clothes and a sleeping bag. He’d given his Govan landlord a week’s notice. The decision felt less like a choice and more like a gravitational pull.

The close was darker now. The single bulb on the stairwell had given up, or been stolen. He used the light from his phone, the beam cutting a shaky path up the worn steps. On the second landing, a door opened a crack as he passed. He caught a glimpse of a pale face, an eye, before it snapped shut. He heard the chain slide across.

He let himself into the flat. The cold hit him first, a deep, settled chill that had seeped into the stone. He turned on the light. Nothing had changed. The stain on the ceiling seemed darker, the continent of damp had grown a new peninsula.

He dumped his bag on the floor. The silence was a physical presence. He’d grown used to the sounds of his Govan flatmates—the thump of bass through the walls, the shouted arguments, the plumbing’s agonised groans. This was different. This was the silence of a vacuum.

To break it, he did the only thing he could think to do. He found the immersion switch behind the bathroom door and flipped it. A deep, electric hum filled the tiny room. *Forty minutes*, Morag’s note had said. He had time.

He decided to find the factor, MacLeod. Get it over with. According to a notice pinned in the close, the factor’s office was on Abercromby Street, a ten-minute walk. He went back out into the drizzle.

The office was a ground-floor conversion in a tired-looking terrace. A handwritten sign in the window read: *MacLeod Property Management*. The ‘u’ in Management was missing. Donnie pushed the door open, setting off a tinny bell.

The room was small, dominated by a large, cluttered desk. Behind it sat a man in his fifties with a face the colour and texture of uncooked dough. He had thin, ginger hair combed over a broad scalp and small, watery eyes that looked up from a racing paper with profound irritation.

“Aye?”

“Are you Mr. MacLeod? The factor for 14 Dalriada Street?”

“I am. Who’s asking?” His voice was a nasal whine.

“Donnie McCallum. I’m in flat three now. My aunt, Morag McCallum, passed.”

The man’s expression didn’t change. No sympathy, no recognition. “Right. What about it?”

“There’s a leak. In the attic. Coming into my ceiling.”

MacLeod sighed, a long-suffering sound. He put down his paper. “A leak.”

“Aye. It’s getting worse.”

“They all say that. It’s an old building. It settles. Gets damp.”

“This is a leak. From the roof. My aunt reported it to you. Several times.”

“Did she now?” MacLeod leaned back, his chair creaking in protest. “I get a lot of reports. Folk see a patch, they panic. Cost of a proper roof inspection is astronomical. Then there’s scaffolding, slates, lead work… you’re talking thousands. Per flat.”

“So what’s the procedure?”

“Procedure is,” MacLeod said, picking up a pen and tapping it on the desk, “I need written reports from all affected residents. Then I get quotes—at least three. Then I call a meeting of the proprietors. Then we vote. If everyone agrees—and I mean *everyone*—we split the cost according to the title deeds. If one person refuses, it doesn’t happen. Then we start again.”

“How long does that take?”

MacLeod gave a thin smile that showed small, yellow teeth. “How long’s a piece of string? Last time we had a repair like this on a building, it took eighteen months from first report to the first bloke on a ladder. And that was a simple gutter.”

Donnie felt the anger from the day before returning, colder now, more focused. “So you do nothing.”

“I follow the process, Mr. McCallum. This isn’t a dictatorship. It’s shared ownership. Democracy in action.” He said the last word with a sneer, as if it were a disease.

“My ceiling’s going to fall in.”

“Then you should get a bucket.” MacLeod picked up his racing paper again, a clear dismissal. “Put your complaint in writing. Drop it through the letterbox. I’ll add it to the file.”

Donnie stood there for a moment, the damp from his jacket steaming slightly in the stuffy office heat. He wanted to reach across the desk and shake the man. But the man was right. It was a system. A slow, grinding, bureaucratic system designed to wear you down until you either gave up or moved out.

He left without another word. The tinny bell rang again behind him.

Back in the flat, the immersion heater had done its work. There was lukewarm water for a shower. He stood under the weak, spraying drizzle, the geyser rumbling like a distant storm. The bathroom was so small his elbows touched the walls. He thought of MacLeod’s smug, doughy face. *Democracy in action.*

He dried off with one of Morag’s thin, grey towels. It smelled faintly of carbolic soap. He unrolled his sleeping bag on the bed, over the taut wool blanket. He didn’t have the nerve to disturb her precise bedding.

He lay in the dark, listening. The city’s night sounds were different up here. More wind in the chimneys, fewer sirens. Then he heard it. A new sound. A soft, steady *drip… drip… drip*.

It was coming from the kitchen.

He got up, padded through. In the light from the streetlamp filtering through the clean window, he saw it. A single, fat drop of water had formed at the heart of the damp stain. It gathered light, swelled, and fell into the empty sink with a clear, resonant *plink*.

*Drip…*

He found a mug and placed it under the spot.

*Plink.*

The sound was absurdly loud in the silence. A clock, measuring out the slow ruin of his inheritance.

He went back to bed, but he didn’t sleep. He lay there, listening to the *plink* in the mug, thinking about democracy, about buckets, about thick walls that couldn’t keep out the relentless, patient rain.

# Chapter 3

## **CHAPTER 3**

The *plink* became the heartbeat of the flat. Donnie woke to it, fell asleep to it. By the third day, he’d upgraded the mug to a stew pot. The drip was constant now, a slow, metronomic seep. The stain on the ceiling had spread, its edges a darker, ominous brown.

He’d written his letter to MacLeod, a terse, factual note, and shoved it through the factor’s letterbox. It felt like throwing a message in a bottle into a stagnant pond.

He had to meet the neighbours. The democracy. Cathy’s words about herding drunk cats echoed in his head. He started on the first floor.

The door with the blaring television was answered by a man in his thirties, shirtless, holding a can of super-strength lager. The room behind him was a cave of flickering light and piled-up laundry. “Aye?”

“I’m Donnie, from the top flat. Morag’s nephew.”

The man’s eyes, bleary, showed no recognition. “Right.”

“There’s a leak in the attic. Affecting my ceiling. We need to get the factor to sort the roof. I need everyone to agree.”

The man took a swig from his can. “Roof? It’s no leaking in here.” He began to close the door.

“It will,” Donnie said, but the door was already shut. The television volume increased.

The opposite door on the first floor was opened by an elderly West Indian woman with a kind, wrinkled face and hair in a colourful headscarf. She introduced herself as Mrs. Grant. She knew Morag. “A lovely woman. Very quiet. Very clean.” She invited him in for tea. Her flat was warm, smelling of incense and curry powder, and was immaculate in a way that felt welcoming, not austere. Photographs of children and grandchildren covered every surface.

“The roof, yes,” she said, handing him a cup of strong, sweet tea. “Miss Morag, she was worried. That man MacLeod is a *battyboy*.” She said it with such serene conviction that Donnie almost choked on his tea. “He will do nothing unless you make him. But Mr. Wallace on the second floor, he will say no. He says no to everything. To the new close light, to the repainting of the stair. He is a man who enjoys the word ‘no’. It is his hobby.”

Mr. Wallace was the man with the comb-over from the funeral. He answered his door on the second landing wearing a cardigan and an expression of profound suspicion. He did not invite Donnie in. He stood in the doorway, a human barrier.

“A new roof?” he said, his voice reedy. “An absolute fortune. How do we know it’s necessary? These factors, they’re in cahoots with the roofers. A wee patch job is all that’s needed. But they’ll have you believing you need a whole new palace.”

“My ceiling is falling in,” Donnie said, keeping his voice level.

“Your ceiling,” Wallace sniffed. “Top floor problems. We’re fine down here. Dry as a bone. Why should I pay for your problems? The building was fine for eighty years before you turned up.”

“The water will work its way down. It’ll damage the fabric of the whole building.”

“Speculation. Fear-mongering. MacLeod sent you, didn’t he? To soften us up for the quote.” Wallace’s eyes narrowed. “I’ll need to see independent surveys. At least two. And I’ll be consulting with the other residents.”

“I *am* the other residents,” Donnie said, exasperation creeping in.

“We’ll see.” And with that, Wallace closed the door. Donnie heard the distinct sound of a deadbolt sliding home.

The other flat on the second floor was empty. A ‘To Let’ sign was taped in the window from an agency he didn’t recognise.

So that was the democracy. One indifferent drunk, one sympathetic but elderly lady, one professional contrarian, and an empty flat. A coalition of the unwilling.

That night, after his shift in the bakery van—the dark, empty streets, the warm, lonely cab smelling of bread—he came home to a new sound. Not a *plink*, but a *splosh*. The stew pot was three-quarters full. The drip had become a trickle. A thin stream of water was now tracing a path down the wall from the edge of the stain.

Enough.

He went to the narrow cupboard in the hallway where Morag kept a few tools. A hammer, a screwdriver, a torch with weak batteries. And, on a high shelf, a folded set of wooden loft steps. He dragged them out, unfolded them, and positioned them under the hatch in the hallway ceiling. It was a painted-over piece of board, no handle.

He pushed it. It didn’t budge. He got the screwdriver, jammed it into the crack, and levered. With a groan of protest and a shower of ancient paint flakes, the hatch lifted and slid aside.

A wave of cold, dead air washed over him. It smelled of centuries of dust, dry rot, and something else—the mineral scent of wet stone. He shone the torch up into the blackness. The beam was pathetic, illuminating only a small circle of thick, black joists and a grey woolly forest of insulation.

He climbed the steps, his head and shoulders entering the space. The attic stretched the length of the building, a long, low tunnel of darkness. The torch beam skittered over water tanks wrapped in lagging, over forgotten trunks, over the skeletal frames of old roof timbers. The air was freezing. He could see his breath.

He crawled forward, the joists creaking under his knees, trying to aim the beam towards the front of the building, above his kitchen. The insulation was thick here, laid between the joists, and he had to move carefully to avoid plunging a leg through the ceiling of the floor below.

Then he saw it.

At the far end, where the roof slates met the wall, a shaft of faint, grey streetlight pierced the darkness. It came through a hole. Not a massive gap, but a missing slate, or a cracked one. The light glinted on something else: a steady, silver trickle of water, running down a rafter, dripping onto the plasterboard lath below, which was sodden and sagging. Directly above his ceiling.

This was it. The source. A single point of failure.

He crawled closer. The water had made a small pond on top of the plasterboard. As he watched, a drop gathered and fell through the sodden material, into the space between the attic and his ceiling. The *plink* machine.

He felt a grim satisfaction. Proof. He could show Wallace, show MacLeod. A photo. Evidence.

He fumbled for his phone, but in the awkward movement, his elbow knocked against something solid and cold, hidden in the insulation beside the water tank.

He aimed the torch.

It was a metal box. A old cash box, green with corrosion, about the size of a large book. It was tucked snugly between two joists, half-buried in the fibreglass wool. It hadn’t been placed there recently; a fine layer of the same dust that covered everything lay on its lid.

Donnie reached for it. It was heavy. He dragged it back towards the hatch, the noise unnaturally loud in the cavernous space.

Back in the hallway, under the electric light, he examined it. It was definitely old. A simple lock, rusted shut. He took it into the kitchen, placed it on the table, and with a few sharp blows from the hammer, the clasp broke.

He lifted the lid.

There was no money. No jewellery.

On top lay a small, yellowing envelope. Beneath it, carefully arranged, were three objects.

A man’s silver wristwatch, old-fashioned, on a leather strap. It had stopped at 4:22.
A single, polished pebble, grey and smooth, the size of a pigeon’s egg.
And a photograph, curled at the edges. It was a picture of a young man, handsome, with a bold, open smile, leaning against the railing of a ship. He was squinting into the sun. On the back, in a flowing, feminine hand, was written: *My Calum, on the *Empress of Canada*, bound for Montreal. May 1957.*

Donnie picked up the envelope. It was not sealed. He slid out a single sheet of paper, the same quality as the note on the pillow.

It was in Morag’s handwriting, but it was different. Less precise. The letters slanted, the lines weren’t perfectly straight. It looked like it had been written quickly, or by a shaking hand.

*Calum,*

*They say time is a great healer. It is not. It is a great thief. It steals the details first. The sound of a laugh. The exact shade of a eye in sunlight. It leaves only the outline, and then it blurs that too, until you are left with a shape of a feeling, and even that feels like a memory of someone else’s memory.*

*I put your things up here because I could not bear to look at them every day, and I could not bear to throw them away. The watch you left on the nightstand. The pebble from Luss beach. The last photograph.*

*You asked me to come. I said no. My job, my mother, this flat. The walls were too thick. Not these stone ones. The ones I built myself. You said they were coward’s walls. You were right.*

*I heard you married a Canadian girl. Had a family. I am glad. Truly. I hope she had no walls at all.*

*The leak started today. In the same spot as always. A reminder that even stone cannot keep everything out forever. Perhaps one day someone will find this, when I am gone, and think me a foolish old woman. They would be correct.*

*But if you are reading this, know this: I have remembered the exact shade of your eyes. Every day. Even when I wished I could forget. They were the colour of the sea at Luss on a cloudy day. Grey-green. And you laughed with your whole head thrown back.*

*Time is all we have. And I wasted mine.*

*M.*

Donnie sat perfectly still. The only sound was the steady *splosh* from the stew pot in the sink.

The flat, the clean, austere, ordered flat, tilted on its axis. The thick walls he’d felt pressing in on him were not just stone. They were her life. Her fortress of solitude, built brick by brick from duty, fear, and a love so sharp it had to be locked away in a rusting box in a damp attic.

He looked at the watch, stopped forever at twenty-two minutes past four. A moment frozen. He looked at the pebble, smooth from a thousand tides. He looked at the photograph of the smiling man, Calum, sailing towards a new life.

A profound and unexpected loneliness engulfed him, but it wasn’t his own. It was hers. It was the ghost in the room, finally speaking, and its voice was a whisper of immense, wasted tenderness.

The *splosh* in the pot seemed to grow louder, urgent. The water was winning. The past was leaking into the present, drip by drip.

He carefully placed the letter and the objects back in the box. He didn’t close the lid.

He had proof of the leak now. But he had also discovered something else: the architecture of a life. And he knew, with a certainty that chilled him more than the attic air, that he could not let this flat—this testament to thick walls and silent regret—go to ruin.

He had to see to it. All of it.

# Chapter 4

## **CHAPTER 4**

The rain had stopped, but the Gallowgate still dripped. It was a slow, rhythmic afterthought, a leaking tap from a bruised sky. Donnie walked, the weight of the rusted box under his arm a new and specific gravity. The clean lines of the flat, the ordered silence, felt like a lie he’d just been told. He’d come to fix a leak. He’d opened a vein.

The *Clansman* was quiet, the lunchtime crowd not yet drifted in. The same condensation greased the windows, but the light was different now. It was a flat, tired light that showed the scuff marks on the floor and the ghost of last night’s spills. He took the same seat by the window. The box he placed on the chair opposite, like a guest he didn’t know how to talk to.

Archie materialised, a damp cloth in one hand, a look of practised boredom on his face. He nodded at the box. “Salvage operation?”

“Something like that,” Donnie said. His voice sounded rough, unused.

“Aye, well. The damp up there’ll claim everything, given time.” Archie swiped at the table, a gesture more habit than hygiene. “You get it sorted?”

“No.”

Archie paused, reading the word. It wasn’t a refusal. It was a statement of geography. Donnie was in a place where leaks in plaster were not the primary concern. The old man gave a slow, deliberate nod, the kind that acknowledged a shift in the weather. “Tea,” he stated, and turned away. It wasn’t an offer. It was a protocol.

Donnie watched the street. A woman wrestled a buggy up the kerb, the wheels catching on the wet stone. A futile, instinctive armour. He saw the young lad from before, tracksuit sleeves sodden, walking with a hollow-eyed focus. Donnie knew the move. The box on the chair seemed to hum with a quiet, accusing frequency.

Archie returned with two mugs. He didn’t ask. He sat, pushing one across the scarred wood. The tea was the colour of the tenement stone, dark and steeped. “She was a quiet one,” Archie said, not looking at Donnie. “Morag. Came in every Friday, regular. A half of stout, one packet of plain crisps. Sat in that corner.” He jerked his head towards a nook by the fire exit. “Never said a word unless you spoke first. And even then, it was like drawing water from a deep, dry well.”

Donnie sipped the tea. It was strong enough to strip paint. “How long?”

“Twenty year? More. Since her brother passed. Calum.” Archie said the name like a fact, a street name. “He was different. A laugh on him. Gone to Canada. Drowned in a lake out there, tragic. She got the flat. And the walls.”

“The walls?”

Archie met his eye. “Aye. She built them, brick by brick. You could see them. When she walked in here, it was like she was carrying them on her shoulders. By the end, she *was* the walls.” He took a gulp of his own tea. “You find anything up in that attic?”

The question was a key, softly turned. Donnie looked at the box. He didn’t open it. He didn’t need to. “I found a stopped watch. A pebble. A photograph.”

A long silence settled between them, filled only by the distant hiss of the coffee machine and the *drip-drip-drip* from the pub’s broken gutter outside. Archie’s face did something complicated. It wasn’t surprise. It was a grim confirmation. “The pebble’ll be from Luss,” he said, finally. “They went there as bairns. Their dad had a van. The photograph’s of Calum, on the boat.”

“You know an awful lot, Archie.”

“I pour drinks. People think it’s the same as being a wall. They talk to the pumps, or the optics. They don’t think you’re listening.” He leaned forward, his elbows on the table. “The watch?”

“Stopped. Twenty-two past four.”

Archie sat back as if pushed. He blew out a long, slow breath that smelled of tea and old tobacco. “Aye. That’ll be when the telegram came. About Calum. She was in here. I remember. She had a half in front of her. She read it, put it in her pocket, finished her drink to the last drop. Never said a thing. But she looked at the clock behind the bar. And that was that. The walls went up for good.”

Donnie felt it then, the profound loneliness, but it wasn’t a ghost. It was a shared, living thing, passed from the silent woman in the corner to the barman who remembered, and now to him. It was the local universal. A private tragedy with the same architecture as a thousand others on this street. The specific shade of grey-green eyes, the exact time of a stopped watch, the particular smoothness of a pebble from a specific shore. The details were hers. The shape of the loss was everyone’s.

“The flat’s a mess,” Donnie said. “Structurally. The water’s getting in somewhere high up. Behind the plaster. It’ll bring the whole ceiling down if it’s not seen to.”

Archie nodded. “And you’re going to see to it.”

It wasn’t a question. Donnie looked at the box. *I have to see to it. All of it.* “I don’t know the first thing about tenement roofs.”

“I know a man,” Archie said. “Rab Anderson. He’s a roofer. A proper one. Not a cowboy. He understands that what’s on top dictates what happens below. He’ll tell you the truth. Which is more than most.”

“Where do I find him?”

“He drinks in the *Railway Tavern* over in Dennistoun. But not on a Tuesday. Tuesday afternoons, he’s at the dogs at Shawfield. Likes the greyhounds. Says they’re the only honest creatures left. All heart, no strategy.” Archie finished his tea. “He’ll be the one looking at the dogs, not the race sheet. You tell him I sent you. He’ll overcharge you, but he’ll do the job right.”

It was the first lesson of this new, damp reality he’d entered: find the man who looks at the dogs, not the sheet. Find the one who understands the heart of the thing, not just the strategy. Donnie committed it to memory. It felt like the first solid thing he’d learned since he’d arrived.

***

Shawfield Stadium smelled of wet turf, cheap meat, and a thin, desperate hope. The rain had left the track slick under the floodlights, which cast a cold, surgical glow over the scene. Donnie moved through the crowd, a sea of flat caps and puffa jackets, men with faces carved from the same granite as the Gallowgate, studying form guides with the intensity of scholars.

He saw Rab Anderson immediately. Archie had been right. He was standing by the rail near the first bend, a short, broad man in a waxed jacket that shone under the lights. He wasn’t looking at his programme. His head was tilted up, watching the kennels. His eyes tracked the greyhounds as they were paraded, a calm, assessing gaze. He watched the way a sleek black dog paced, its muscles quivering under a coat like oiled silk. He watched a brindle bitch who stood unnervingly still, her focus absolute, aimed down the track at nothing.

Donnie approached, the noise of the crowd a dull roar. “Rab Anderson?”

The man turned. His face was a roadmap of old weathering, his eyes a pale, watery blue. “Who’s asking?”

“Archie from the *Clansman* sent me.”

A flicker of recognition. “Archie’s a good judge of character. Usually. What’s your business?”

“A roof. A tenement on the Gallowgate. Water’s coming in behind the plaster. Archie said you understand what’s on top dictates what happens below.”

Rab considered him, then looked back at the dogs. The black one was now straining at its lead, a coil of pure energy. “Aye, that’s the truth of it. You can paper over the damp inside all you like, but if the slate’s cracked or the flashing’s failed, you’re just painting a rot. Who’s the flat?”

“Morag McAllister’s.”

Rab’s head snapped round. The calm assessment was gone, replaced by something sharper. “Morag’s gone, then.”

“Aye.”

He was silent for a long moment, watching as the dogs were led into the traps. The mechanical hare buzzed on its rail. “I did a patch job for her, must be ten year back. South-facing slope. She wouldn’t let me do the whole thing. Said she couldn’t afford it. I told her it was a temporary fix. That the water would find a way. She said everything finds a way, eventually.” He shook his head. “Stubborn. Proud. The worst kind.”

The bell clanged. The traps flew open. A surge of raw, streamlined motion exploded onto the track. The crowd’s roar became a specific, yelling thing. Rab didn’t yell. He watched, his body still, as the black dog and the brindle bitch pulled ahead, neck and neck, a blur of driving legs and focused intent. They rounded the bend where they stood, a rush of air and effort. The brindle had the inside line. She held it, tight to the rail, a model of ruthless efficiency. The black dog, all heart, tried to push past on the outside, wasting energy, losing ground.

“See that?” Rab said, his voice almost lost in the din. “The brindle. She knows the geometry. The black dog… he just wants to run. Heart’s not enough. You need to know the angles.” The brindle crossed the finish line a length ahead. The crowd’s reaction splintered into curses and scattered cheers. Rab turned fully to Donnie. “I’ll look at Morag’s roof. For her. Not for you. Tomorrow. Eight AM. You meet me there with the key. And a ladder. You got a ladder?”

“No.”

“Get one. You’ll be holding it.”

It was the test. Not of skill, but of willingness. To be the hands, to be the one standing on the sodden ground, bearing the weight, looking up. Donnie nodded. “I’ll get a ladder.”

***

The ladder was aluminium, cold and shockingly light. Donnie held it steady as Rab, moving with a stiff, practiced grace, ascended into the overcast morning. The backgreen of the tenement was a patch of struggling grass and broken paving, hemmed in by walls of weeping stone. From this angle, the building looked even taller, more forbidding.

Rab’s boots scraped on the rungs, then there was silence. Donnie could feel the strain in his own shoulders, a tremor in the ladder. He looked up, but all he could see was the bottom of Rab’s waxed jacket and the dark, corrugated underbelly of the roof.

After a long minute, a voice floated down, muffled. “It’s as I thought. The flashing’s gone. Rusted through. The water’s been getting in behind the coping stone for years. Running down the inner skin of the wall, hiding. Then it hits her ceiling and announces itself.” A pause. More scraping. “There’s moss. Thick. Holding the moisture like a sponge. And a slate’s slipped. Not recent.”

“Can it be fixed?”

A derisive snort from above. “Everything can be fixed. Question is the price. And what you find when you start peeling it back.” Rab descended, his face grim. He stepped onto the grass and wiped his hands on his trousers. “The temporary patch I did is holding, miraculously. It’s the original work that’s failing. The whole valley needs re-leading. The moss needs stripped. That slipped slate is just the start. You lift it, you might find three more underneath are cracked.”

“So what’s the answer?”

Rab looked at him, then at the towering wall. “The answer is you need scaffolding. Not just a ladder. You need to strip a section back, see the full damage. It’s a big job. A costly job.” He named a figure. It was a cold, hard number that seemed to suck the sound from the backgreen. “And that’s just to make it watertight. That doesn’t fix what’s already spoiled inside.”

Donnie thought of the stained ceiling, the swollen door. The stopped watch in the box. “And if we don’t?”

Rab’s pale eyes were merciless. “The water wins. It gets into the timber. The lathe. The rot sets in. One winter, maybe two, and that ceiling comes down. Then the whole flat’s a shell. A memorial to damp. Just like a hundred others in this city.” He spat onto the grass. “It’s what happens. People build walls. The rain finds a way in. They patch. The rain finds another way. It’s a war of attrition, son. And the rain’s got forever.”

It was the revelation. The minor antagonist wasn’t a person; it was the inevitable, patient force of decay. The larger opposing force was entropy itself, disguised as weather, as time, as the slow, chemical betrayal of materials. Morag had fought it with silence and order. Rab fought it with lead and labour. And both were just temporary fixes in a long, losing battle.

“Set up the scaffolding,” Donnie heard himself say. The words felt like they came from someone else. “Do what needs doing.”

Rab studied him, reassessing. “You’re not family.”

“No.”

“Then why?”

Donnie looked up at the roof, at the spot where the hidden flaw was. *The architecture of a life.* “Because someone should.”

Rab held his gaze for a long moment, then gave a single, slow nod. It was the same nod Archie had given. An acceptance of a shared, pointless, necessary duty. “Right. I’ll get the boys. We’ll start Monday. It’ll be noisy. It’ll be a mess. And when we open it up, I’ll show you exactly what you’ve bought into.”

***

The scaffolding went up on Monday. It was a skeletal invasion, a web of metal tubes and clamps that transformed the front of the tenement. It echoed under boots, a hollow, industrial sound that was foreign to the old stone. Donnie spent the day inside, following Rab’s instructions to move furniture, roll up the threadbare hall carpet, cover Morag’s austere sofa with a dust sheet. It felt like a violation, but a necessary one.

Rab’s ‘boys’ were two taciturn men in their fifties, Stevie and Tam, who worked with a wordless, rhythmic efficiency. By mid-afternoon, the hammering started above—the sound of the rotten fascia being ripped away. With each blow, the flat trembled. A fine, ancient dust sifted down from the ceiling rose in the slanting light from the window.

Then, a shout from above. Rab’s voice, sharp. “McCallum! Up here. Now.”

Donnie climbed the ladder inside the scaffolding cage. The world narrowed to the grid of metal under his hands, the gaping void of the backgreen below. He emerged onto the boarded platform at roof level. The wind was sharper here, carrying the city’s smell of exhaust and distant fryers. The view was a panorama of slated peaks, chimney pots, and satellite dishes—a ragged skyline.

Rab was crouched by the exposed valley. The failed lead flashing was peeled back like a rotten bandage. Underneath, where the roof met the wall, was a blackened, wet cavity. But Rab wasn’t looking at the rot. He was holding something. It was a small, sodden bundle of cloth, wedged deep into the gap where the flashing had been.

“Found this,” Rab said, his voice neutral. He handed it to Donnie.

It was heavy with absorbed water. Donnie unfolded the rough, mildewed wool. Inside was a tin—a old tobacco tin, green paint flaked away to rust. His fingers, gone cold, prised the stiff lid open.

Inside, protected from the worst of the wet by the wool and the tin, were letters. A small, tied bundle. The top one was addressed, in a flowing, feminine hand, to *Mr. Calum McAllister, Halifax, Nova Scotia*. The stamp was British, the postmark smudged but legible: *Glasgow, 1974*. It had never been sent.

The hammering had stopped. Stevie and Tam were watching, their faces unreadable. The wind whistled through the scaffolding tubes. Donnie looked from the unsent letters in his hand to the gaping wound in the roof, to Rab’s grim, knowing face.

The water had found a way. It always did. And in its patient, destructive path, it had forced a secret to the surface. Not just a structural flaw, but a emotional one, bricked up and leaded over decades ago. Morag hadn’t just hidden her memories in an attic. She had sealed a part of her heart into the very fabric of the building, into the last place any repair might look. A final, futile attempt at waterproofing a feeling.

Rab nodded at the letters. “Told you,” he said, the words barely more than a breath against the wind. “You start peeling it back. You never know what you’ll find.”

Donnie stood on the trembling platform, the city spread out below him, the unsent words a cold weight in his hand. The job had just become infinitely more complicated. He had come to fix a leak. He was now an archaeologist of silence, and the dig had only just begun. The past wasn’t just leaking; it was flooding out, and he was standing directly in its path.

# Chapter 5

## **CHAPTER 5**

The van smelled of wet cement, stale tobacco, and a new, sharp note of unease. It crawled through the morning traffic of the Saltmarket, a grey metal box holding its breath. Donnie sat in the passenger seat, the tobacco tin a hard rectangle in the pocket of his jacket, pressed against his ribs. Rab drove, his knuckles white on the wheel, eyes fixed on the tail-lights of the car in front. In the back, Stevie and Tam were a silent, bulky presence. The letters, now carefully separated and dried between sheets of newspaper, were in a Morrisons bag at Donnie’s feet. They were a presence, a fifth passenger. Their silence was the loudest thing in the van.

The tenements here were taller, blacker, their sandstone facades scabbed with decades of grime and neglect. The grand Victorian arches of the markets were shuttered with steel, graffiti blooming like aggressive mould across the shutters. This was still the city, but the grammar of it had changed. The Gallowgate’s decay had a weary, domestic ache to it. This was different. This decay was territorial, a series of hard lines and contested boundaries. They were driving into the belly of a different beast.

“Next left,” Donnie said, his voice rough. “Then it’s the yard behind the old bonded warehouse.”

Rab nodded, a tight dip of the chin. He didn’t ask how Donnie knew. Some things you just knew. You knew the move, the futile hunch of the shoulders. You knew the streets that asked no questions, and the ones that asked too many.

The yard was a cracked concrete basin surrounded on three sides by the sheer, windowless brick walls of derelict industrial buildings. The fourth side was open to the river, separated by a rusted chain-link fence sagging under the weight of dead ivy. The *Meridian* sat in the centre, a hulking silhouette against the flat, grey sheet of the Clyde. It wasn’t a tenement; it was a fortress. A four-storey former sail-loft, its red brick was the colour of dried blood, its rows of arched windows boarded up with thick, weather-stained ply. A single, spindly construction crane stood sentinel beside it, its arm drooping like a wilted flower.

Rab killed the engine. The silence that followed was thick, punctured only by the distant thrum of the city and the impatient cry of a gull.

“Right,” Stevie said from the back, the word exploding in the quiet. “This is it? This is the big job? A haunted hoose in the middle of bloody nowhere?”

“It’s not a house,” Tam said, his voice low. “It’s a tomb.”

Donnie got out. The air here was cold and carried the damp, organic stink of the river—mud, diesel, and something sweetly rotten. He looked up at the *Meridian*. The name was a joke. There was no centre here, no balance. It was an end point. The scaffolding was already partly erected on the river-facing side, a skeletal embrace around the old brick. Their job was to finish it, assess the roof, and begin the pointing. A simple, brutal exercise in muscle and mortar.

But the tin against his ribs said otherwise.

They unloaded the gear in a wordless, efficient rhythm born of a hundred jobs. The mixer, the bags of sand and cement, the toolboxes, the rolls of damp-proof membrane. The materials formed a neat, hopeful pile on the stained concrete. A tiny outpost of order against the vast, crumbling indifference of the place.

As Tam fired up the petrol generator to run the kettle, Rab came to stand beside Donnie, following his gaze up to the roof-line. “See it?” Rab murmured.

Donnie saw it. At the very top of the building, beneath the stone parapet, the brickwork was discoloured in a long, weeping stain. It started at the corner and bled downwards, a dark, vertical river against the brick. It was the same tell-tale sign as Morag’s place, but magnified, more virulent. A structural sepsis.

“Water’s getting in behind the parapet wall,” Donnie said. “Probably no proper through-wall flashing. Just mortar. It’s turned to slurry.”

“Aye,” Rab said. “And it’s been doing it for a long, long time.” He lit a cigarette, cupping his hand against the breeze coming off the river. “This is no a repair, Donnie. This is a confession. Someone’s paying a fortune for us to open this up. Why?”

Before Donnie could answer, a door creaked within the deep shadow of the building’s ground floor. A man stepped out. He was in his fifties, dressed in immaculate charcoal trousers and a black wool overcoat that looked too thin for the weather. His hair was silver, cut sharp. He carried no clipboard, wore no high-vis. He moved with a quiet, unsettling certainty across the yard.

“McCallum?” he asked, though his eyes had gone straight to Donnie.

“Aye.”

“Mr. Lyle. I represent the ownership consortium.” He didn’t offer a hand. His gaze swept over Rab, over Stevie and Tam who had stopped to watch, then back to the building. “You’re behind schedule. The scaffold should be complete.”

“Weather,” Donnie said, the old, automatic defence.

“The weather is a constant,” Lyle said, his voice devoid of inflection. “The schedule is not. You have access to the interior. The roof is your primary concern. Make it watertight. Everything else is secondary.” He finally looked at Donnie, and his eyes were the colour of the river on a sunless day. “You will encounter… historical modifications. Do not be distracted. Your remit is the fabric. The skin. Nothing else. Understood?”

It was a warning. Delivered politely, in the cadence of a project update, but a warning all the same. *Don’t peel it back.*

“Understood,” Donnie heard himself say.

Lyle gave a single, neat nod and turned, disappearing back into the shadow of the doorway as silently as he’d arrived.

“Right friendly, that,” Stevie muttered, plugging in the kettle. “Gives you the warm fuzzies, so he does.”

Tam said nothing. He was staring at the doorway where Lyle had vanished, his broad face set.

“Final preparations,” Donnie said, forcing a tone of business. “Rab, you and Stevie finish the high-level scaffolding on the river side. Tam, you’re with me. We’ll get inside, see what we’re dealing with from the attic down.”

The plan was sound. It was what they did. But as they split, the air in the yard seemed to tighten. The preparation felt less like a beginning and more like a ritual before a crossing.

***

Inside, the *Meridian* was a cathedral of dust and echoes. The ground floor was a vast, empty space, the original wooden floors scarred and splintered, the ceiling a distant network of iron girders and cobwebs. Light filtered in through the cracks in the boarded windows, cutting sharp, dusty blades through the gloom. The air was frigid and still, smelling of old timber, pigeon droppings, and the faint, metallic tang of the river.

Donnie and Tam made their way to a set of iron stairs at the back, their footsteps ringing too loud in the hollow silence. The second and third floors were partitioned into smaller rooms—old offices, storage spaces—their doors hanging open on broken hinges, revealing emptiness. The silence here was not peaceful. It was a held breath.

“This place is wrong,” Tam said, his voice a low rumble in the stillness. They were on the third-floor landing, looking up the final, narrower flight to the attic door.

“It’s just old,” Donnie said, the automatic response.

“Naw.” Tam shook his head. “Old is Morag’s place. That’s… sad. This is different. This place is *waiting*.”

Donnie pushed open the attic door. The space was long and low, running the length of the building, the roof beams exposed like the ribs of a great, dead animal. Here, the evidence of the leak was immediate and shocking. The far end of the attic was a disaster zone. Plaster had fallen from the laths in great, ragged chunks, exposing the ancient, blackened timber beneath. A large section of the floorboards was warped into a sinister, dark bowl, pooled with stagnant, tea-coloured water. The air was thick with the smell of wet rot, a sweet, cloying scent that made the back of the throat itch.

And it was full of stuff.

Where Morag’s attic had been a curated museum, this was a chaotic dumping ground. Crates were stacked haphazardly, their contents spilling out: ledgers with cracked spines, bundles of yellowed invoices tied with string, rusted tools, the skeletal frame of a tailor’s dummy. In one corner stood a stack of framed portraits, the glass cracked, the faces of severe men and women staring blankly into the damp. It was the detritus of a commercial empire, bricked up and forgotten.

“Historical modifications,” Donnie muttered, Lyle’s phrase tasting sour in his mouth.

Tam walked slowly to the centre of the space, his boots careful on the sound-looking boards. He was looking not at the water damage, but at the walls. They were lined, in places, with shelves, and on those shelves were rows and rows of glass jars. They were dusty, many coated in a greenish film. Donnie moved closer. The jars were filled with dark, shrivelled things. Prunes? Dates? He wiped the dust from one label. The ink was faded but legible: *Specimen 47. *Homo sapiens* dentition. 1898.*

“Teeth,” Tam said, his voice flat. “They’re full of teeth.”

Donnie recoiled. He looked around with new eyes. The crates weren’t just for ledgers. One, pried open, held long, thin bones bundled like kindling. Another was packed with what looked like lumps of dark, porous coral. Petrused organs. This wasn’t just an archive. It was a charnel house for a business that had traded in bodies. The *Meridian* hadn’t just stored sails and rope. It had stored people, or pieces of them, for medical schools. A respectable, hidden trade.

The universal horror of the charnel, dressed in the local, mundane garb of commerce and storage.

“We’re not fixing a roof,” Tam said, turning to face Donnie. His usual stoicism was gone, replaced by a deep, visceral revulsion. “We’re disturbing a grave. A mass grave. That man, Lyle… he knows. He told you not to be distracted. He doesn’t want us seeing *this*.”

“It’s just old medical specimens, Tam,” Donnie said, but the argument was weak, hollowed out by the cold and the rows of silent, watching jars.

“Is it?” Tam’s eyes were wide in the gloom. “And what about the letters, Donnie? What did they say? You’ve read them. I saw your face this morning.”

The tension that had been simmering since the yard boiled over. Here, in this attic of teeth and bones, the fears surfaced, raw and undeniable.

“They’re private,” Donnie snapped.

“Aye, and so is this!” Tam gestured wildly at the macabre collection. “It’s all the same! It’s all the stuff they bricked up and hid away and hoped the water wouldn’t find! We’re not tradesmen anymore. We’re… we’re ghouls. Picking at the seams of things that should stay buried.”

“It’s a job, Tam. We need the money. You know what happens if we walk.”

“I know what happens if we stay!” Tam’s voice rose, echoing in the cavernous space. “This gets into you. This… silence. This weight. You think you can just point a wall and walk away? That water’s been finding a way for a hundred years. It’s showing us this for a reason. And that reason isn’t so we can slap on some mortar and collect a cheque.”

Their argument hung in the rotten air, a tangible thing alongside the smell of decay. It was the fear speaking—the fear of what they were uncovering, the fear of the cold, watchful presence of Lyle, the fear that some leaks, once started, could never be stopped.

The sound of boots on the iron stairs broke the standoff. Rab appeared at the attic door, his face grim. He took in the scene—the water damage, the jars, the tension between the two men—in one swift glance.

“Scaffold’s ready on the outside,” he said, his voice carefully neutral. “Stevie’s setting up the hoist. You two finished the survey?”

“Aye,” Donnie said, tearing his gaze from Tam. “The leak’s source is the parapet. We need to get up on that roof, take the coping stones off, see the carnage.”

Rab nodded. “Then that’s what we do.” He looked at Tam, held his eye for a second. A silent communication passed between them. *Later*. “The only way out is through, boys. Always has been.”

***

The final barrier was the roof itself. To access the parapet, they had to cross from the scaffolding onto the steep, slippery slate roof. It was a simple, physical act, but it felt profoundly symbolic. They were leaving the relative safety of the scaffold’s metal grid, stepping onto the ancient, weathered skin of the building itself. Into the dangerous zone.

The wind was sharper up here, a constant, whining pressure. The city lay below them, a grey-and-green tapestry, but the view felt irrelevant, a picture behind glass. All that existed was the line of the roof ridge and the stone parapet that edged it, a low wall about three feet high.

Donnie went first, moving on hands and feet, finding purchase on the slates with the rubber soles of his boots. The cold bit through his gloves. He reached the parapet, a solid bulk of sandstone blocks, and hauled himself up to peer over. The other side was a sheer drop, four storeys down to the concrete yard. The coping stones—the long, capping stones along the top—were loose. He could rock one with his hand. The mortar was pure powder.

“It’s gone,” he called back to Rab, who was waiting on the scaffold platform. “All of it. It’s just dust.”

One by one, they lifted the heavy coping stones free, passing them hand-to-hand back to the scaffold platform where Stevie stacked them. With the copings removed, the true extent of the failure was revealed. The inner wall of the parapet was saturated, a mush of disintegrated brick and mortar. But as Donnie began to clear the soggy debris with a trowel, his blade hit something that wasn’t brick.

“Rab.”

Rab leaned over. Donnie scraped more carefully. It was cloth. Thick, oiled canvas, like that of a sailor’s duffel, wedged deep into the core of the wall. It was part of the structure, deliberately placed. A secret compartment within the stone.

Donnie’s heart was a dull hammer against the tin in his pocket. He looked at Rab. Rab’s face was set, a mask of resignation. *You start peeling it back.*

With numb fingers, Donnie hooked the canvas and pulled. It came free with a wet, sucking sound. It wasn’t a large bundle. He carried it back across the roof, the wind plucking at it, and laid it on the scaffold platform.

Stevie and Tam gathered round. No one spoke.

Donnie unfolded the stiff, tar-stiffened canvas. Inside was a leather satchel, cracked with age. He unbuckled it. Not letters this time. Ledgers. Three of them, bound in black. He opened the top one. The pages were densely filled with columns of numbers and notations in a tight, precise hand. But these weren’t invoices for hemp or pitch. The columns were headed: *Subject. Age. Source. Condition. Disposition. Fee.*

*Subject 211: Male, approx. 25. River. Poor. To Dr. M. For dissection. £2/10.*
*Subject 212: Female, stillborn. Lying-in Hospital. Excellent. To University Collection. £5.*

Page after page of it. A ledger of the dead. A balance sheet for the jars in the attic below. The cold, commercial truth of it was more horrifying than any ghost story. This was the local, universal truth: everything, even a human body, could be commodified, given a number, a price, a disposition.

But at the very back of the last ledger, tucked into the binding, was a single, folded sheet of paper. It was different—softer, a personal writing paper. Donnie unfolded it.

It was a letter, but unsent like the others. The handwriting was the same flowing script as the letters to Nova Scotia. *My dearest Calum,* it began. It spoke of a child. A boy. Born in the spring of 1975. *They will not let me keep him. They say it is for the best, that a child needs a proper home, a father. They have arranged everything. He is to be taken to the home on the morrow. They say I must never speak of it, that it is the price of my silence, and of his future. I have signed the papers. My heart is bricked up within these walls. I am so afraid the water will find it…*

The letter ended abruptly, as if the writer had been interrupted, or could bear no more.

Donnie looked up from the page, his vision blurring. He looked from the ledgers of the dead to the letter about the living. The *Meridian* hadn’t just traded in corpses. It had traded in secrets, in lives, in the quiet, desperate tragedies of the living. Morag’s unsent letters to a lover in Canada. This unknown woman’s lost child. It was all the same currency. The building wasn’t just leaking water. It was leaking grief. A vast, slow flood of it, held back by crumbling stone and bad mortar.

The wind whistled through the scaffolding tubes with a keening note. The four men stood on their trembling metal island, high above the city, surrounded by the evidence of a silent, systemic violence. The job, the simple fix, was gone. Shattered.

Rab was the first to move. He gently took the ledgers and the letter from Donnie’s hands, placing them back in the satchel. His face was ancient, carved from the same granite as the weeping tenements.

“Lyle told you not to be distracted,” Rab said, his voice barely audible over the wind. “Now you know why.”

He looked out over the parapet, towards the river. “He’s here.”

Donnie followed his gaze. Down in the yard, standing beside their van, was the neat, grey figure of Mr. Lyle. He wasn’t looking up at them. He was looking at the open doorway of the *Meridian*. And he was not alone. Two other men, larger, their coats bulging slightly at the sides, stood with him. They were waiting.

The final barrier hadn’t been the roof. It had been the truth. And they had crossed it. Now, they had to get down.

# Chapter 6

## **CHAPTER 6**

The descent was worse than the climb. The metal rungs were slick with the city’s breath, each one a cold shock through Donnie’s gloves. He moved last, the satchel with its terrible cargo slung across his back, bumping against his spine with every step. It felt heavier now, loaded with more than paper. Below, the three figures by the van hadn’t moved. They were a still life in the yard’s grimy concrete: Patient Men Waiting. The wind that had been a roar on the roof was down here a low, mean whistle through the scaffolding, carrying the distant, tinny shout of a pie-seller from Argyle Street. Normal life, carrying on. It felt like a mockery.

Rab reached the bottom first, his boots hitting the wet ground with a final-sounding slap. He didn’t approach the van. He stood, a solid, unmovable block, and waited for the others. Tam came next, then Stevie, their faces closed, wiped clean of the horror they’d just shared. It was a tradesman’s trick. You saw the rotten joist, the black mould spreading behind the plaster, and then you sealed your face up before you went to tell the client. You gave nothing away for free.

Donnie’s feet found the ground. The solidity of it was a jolt. He’d been up in the realm of ghosts and old rain; now he was back in the kingdom of cracked concrete and waiting men. He straightened up, the satchel’s weight settling.

Mr. Lyle detached himself from the shadow of the van. He didn’t walk so much as glide, a neat, grey spectre over the puddled ground. His shoes were polished to a dull, respectable shine. The two men with him didn’t follow. They were bookends, thick-necked and silent, their coats hanging just wrong. They watched. Their job was watching.

“Gentlemen,” Lyle said. His voice was dry, like pages turning in a closed book. His eyes, pale and assessing, went from Rab’s granite face to the satchel on Donnie’s back. “A productive morning, I trust? The membrane is secured?”

Rab’s voice was a low grind. “The roof’s a coffin, Lyle. And it’s full.”

Lyle’s smile was a thin, professional thing. A dentist’s smile. “A colourful metaphor. I asked about the membrane.”

“The membrane’s fucked,” Stevie said, the heat in his voice cutting through the yard’s chill. “Because the whole thing’s fucked. There’s bodies up there. Papers.”

The smile didn’t waver. It simply became a different kind of thing. Not warmth, but a tool for measuring distance. “I see. You’ve been… distracted.”

“We found what you didn’t want found,” Donnie said. The words came out flat, toneless. He was too tired for anger. The greasy rain was starting again, a fine mist beading on Lyle’s grey wool shoulders.

Lyle’s gaze settled on him. It was like being examined by a camera lens, something cold and mechanical. “I engaged you to stop a leak, Mr. McCallum. Not to go treasure-hunting in the attic. The past has a way of… weeping through. My concern is the present. The structure. The sale.”

“Sale?” Tam barked a laugh that held no humour. “You’re selling this?”

“The *Meridian* has stood derelict for decades. It is an eyesore. My clients wish to redevelop. Bring life back to this quarter. A noble endeavour, wouldn’t you say?” Lyle spread his hands, a benign gesture. “A few historical curiosities cannot be allowed to derail progress. The city moves on.”

Donnie felt the letter in his mind, the desperate script. *My heart is bricked up within these walls.* “What kind of progress needs a bairn stolen and a woman’s heart bricked up to happen?”

For the first time, a flicker of something live crossed Lyle’s face. Annoyance. The careful script was being deviated from. “Sentimentality. The tragic ramblings of a bygone age. This city was built on harder stuff than that. You, of all people, should know. The Gallowgate doesn’t weep for its dead, Mr. McCallum. It walks over them.”

He took a step closer. The smell of him was wrong here—expensive wool and a hint of cologne against the backdrop of wet stone and decay. “Give me the satchel. Your contract is concluded. A bonus for your discretion, of course. A significant one. You walk away. The leak, as far as anyone need know, was a blocked gutter.”

The four men stood together. The rain needled the back of Donnie’s neck. He saw the young lad with the chips again, shoulders hunched. A futile armour. He saw Morag’s looping script, the ledger’s grim tally. He saw the unnamed woman’s fear, so alive it had seeped into the paper. It wasn’t history. It was a live wire, buried in the walls, and they’d touched it.

“No,” Donnie said.

The word hung in the damp air, small and final.

Lyle blinked slowly. “I’m sorry?”

“The satchel’s not yours. It belongs to the building. To them.” Donnie nodded back towards the towering, weeping facade.

Lyle’s sigh was one of profound, weary disappointment. “Then you leave me no choice.” He gave a slight, almost imperceptible nod.

The two bookends moved. They moved well, for big men—a coordinated, practised advance that cut off any route to the street. One stood behind Lyle, a hand now visibly resting inside his coat. The other circled wide, towards the open doorway of the *Meridian*.

Rab shifted his weight, the subtle coiling of a man who knows how a site fight starts. Tam and Stevie closed ranks beside Donnie. It was a silent, solid thing. They were tradesmen, not fighters. But they were Glasgow tradesmen. They knew how to stand their ground.

“This is foolish,” Lyle said, his voice regaining its smooth composure. “You have families. Mortgages. You are small men, in a small business. This is not your concern. Give me the bag, take the money, and go back to your lives of fixing leaks that are meant to be fixed.”

He was right. That was the marrow-deep truth of it. They were fixers of the small, agreed-upon broken things. This was too big. It was a crack in the world itself.

Donnie’s hand went to the strap of the satchel. He felt the cheap, damp grain of the leather. He thought of handing it over. Walking away. Letting the *Meridian* and its silent, bricked-up grief be buried under glass and steel, another anonymous block. The city would indeed walk over it. It was the Glasgow way.

Then he saw Rab’s face. Not anger, but a deep, weary recognition. Rab, who’d been on the sites since he was a boy, who’d seen corners cut and stories covered with a smear of mortar. Rab, who knew the price of looking away. He gave a single, almost invisible shake of his head.

Donnie’s hand fell from the strap. “You’ll need to take it.”

Lyle’s lips thinned. “So be it.”

The bookend by the door moved first, lunging not for Donnie but for Rab, the biggest threat. Rab met him with a tradesman’s efficiency, a short, hard shove that sent the man stumbling back into the doorframe with a hollow boom. The other man’s hand came out of his coat, empty but clenched into a fist like a lump hammer.

Chaesis, then. It wasn’t a fight, not like in the films. It was a brutal, clumsy scramble in the rain-slick yard. Stevie went down with a grunt, tripped by Lyle’s expertly extended foot. Tam swung a fist, connecting with a shoulder, the sound a wet slap. Donnie turned, putting his back to the van, the satchel between him and the metal. The bookend with the fists advanced on him, his breath clouding in the cold air.

Lyle watched, a curator at a disappointing exhibition. “Just take the bag, Alec.”

Alec reached for it. Donnie twisted away, but a fist caught him high on the cheekbone. Light exploded in a white star behind his eyes. He staggered, the world tilting. He felt hands clawing at the satchel strap, yanking him off balance. He fell to one knee, the cold water of a puddle soaking through his trousers. He held onto the strap, a stupid, stubborn grip. Another blow landed, this one on his ribs, driving the air from him in a sickening rush. He saw Rab grappling with the other man by the door, saw Tam trying to get up, a hand to his bloody mouth.

He was failing. They all were. The truth was a heavy, useless thing. It couldn’t block a fist. It couldn’t stop a boot. Alec wrenched the satchel free. The strap tore, but it came away in his hands. He tossed it towards Lyle, who caught it with a look of distaste for the damp, dirty object.

Donnie knelt in the puddle, gasping, the taste of iron in his mouth. The victory in Lyle’s eyes was quiet, absolute. It was the look of a man who had always known how this would end. The system, neat and grey and violent, had reasserted itself. The small men had been put back in their place.

“A regrettable necessity,” Lyle said, brushing a speck of dirt from the satchel. “The bonus is withdrawn, of course. You will invoice for the original scope only. And you will forget you were ever here. If you speak of this… my associates will revisit your small businesses. Your homes. It will be a different conversation.”

He turned to go. The bookend, Alec, gave Donnie one last, contemptuous shove with his boot, sending him fully onto his side in the cold water. The humiliation was a colder burn than the pain. He lay there, watching Lyle’s polished shoes walk away, the satchel swinging from his hand. The proof. The stories. The bricked-up heart. All walking away into the Glasgow drizzle.

The van doors slammed. The engine started, a low growl that echoed off the stone walls. Then it faded, turning out of the yard and onto the street, swallowed by the city’s noise.

Silence, broken only by the drip of water and Stevie’s low groan as he pushed himself up. Rab stood by the doorway, his chest heaving, a trickle of blood from his nose dark against his stubble. Tam spat red into a puddle.

They had lost. They had been beaten, bought off, and silenced. The *Meridian* loomed over them, weeping its black tears, its secrets now in the hands of a man in a grey coat who spoke of progress. Donnie rolled onto his back, the wet concrete leaching the heat from his body. The sky above was a uniform, miserable white. A proper Glasgow sky. It offered nothing.

Rab walked over, his shadow falling across Donnie. He didn’t offer a hand up. He just looked down, his face a landscape of defeat. “Told you,” he said, his voice hoarse. “Told you not to be distracted.”

They gathered their tools in silence. The scattered mallets, the coiled rope, the unused sheets of membrane. It was a funeral for the job. No one spoke. The drive back to the lock-up was a void. Stevie nursed his side. Tam stared out the window, wiping at his split lip. Donnie touched his throbbing cheekbone, feeling the swell begin.

At the lock-up, they unloaded without a word. The camaraderie of the morning was ash. They were just four battered men who’d stepped out of their lane and been run off the road.

“Right,” Rab said finally, locking the shutters with a definitive clang. “That’s that.”

He didn’t look at them. He just got in his own car and drove away.

Tam and Stevie shared a look, a silent communication of shame and anger, then mumbled their goodbyes and left.

Donnie was alone in the empty yard behind the lock-up. The rain had settled into a steady, soaking drizzle. He felt hollowed out. Beaten. He’d led them into it, his stubborn need to see what was behind the wall. And for what? A sore face, a lost bonus, and the certain knowledge that the bad guys had won. The local, universal truth: the grey men always win. They had the fists, the money, the cold patience. People like him had puddles and bruises.

He drove home to his flat in Dennistoun. It was a first-floor box, sparsely furnished, the lingering smell of last night’s fish supper. He stood in the shower, letting the hot water beat on his aching ribs, watching the dirt from the *Meridian* swirl down the plughole. Trying to wash the failure off.

He made a strong tea, sat at his small table by the window. The clock ticked. The flat was silent. He saw Lyle’s face. The casual power. The way he’d caught the satchel. *A regrettable necessity.*

Donnie’s own hands were curled around the mug. Broad, scarred hands. A tradesman’s hands. They could fix a burst pipe, replace a rotten joist, seal a leak. But they couldn’t hold back a flood of grief. They couldn’t rebuild a stolen life.

He looked at them. At the black grime still ingrained around the nails, a souvenir from the roof. From handling the ledgers. From touching the past.

And something clicked.

A small, hard thing, like a tumbler falling in a lock.

He saw it again. Lyle catching the satchel. The look of distaste. Not just for the dirt. For the object itself. He’d handled it like it was contaminated. And then he’d taken it. Secured it.

But before that, in the yard, when Donnie had refused… Lyle had nodded to his men. *Then* they had moved. The threat of force came *after* the refusal. The primary objective had been the satchel. The silencing was a secondary concern, a tidy-up operation.

Why?

If the ledgers and the letter were just “historical curiosities,” why was their retrieval so urgent? Why not let the tradesmen keep them? They’d have no proof, no credibility. Just a mad story from a leaky roof. Lyle could have denied it, laughed it off. Instead, he’d risked a messy, public confrontation in a yard that wasn’t entirely private. He’d revealed his hand, his violent capacity.

Because the contents of the satchel weren’t just evidence of the past.

They were a key to something in the present.

Donnie stood up so fast his chair scraped the linoleum. The pain in his ribs flared, a sharp reminder of his defeat. But his mind was cold and clear now, the fog of shock and humiliation burned away.

Lyle was afraid of what was in those papers. Not the story, but the specifics. The names. The dates. The transactions. The *Meridian* hadn’t just been a mortuary. It had been a clearing house. A ledger of the disappeared. And if it was a ledger…

…there would be a counterpart.

A record of where they went. Of who paid. Of who benefited.

The *Meridian* held one half of the secret. Lyle, or his “clients,” held the other. And the two halves could not be allowed to meet. The development wasn’t just about profit. It was about burial. A final, concrete burial of the evidence.

Donnie’s hands weren’t useless. They were the hands that had found the first half. The hands that had pulled the satchel from the dark.

He went to his bedroom, pulled a battered holdall from under the bed. He didn’t pack clothes. He packed tools. A heavy-duty flashlight. A small crowbar. A lock-pick set he’d inherited from an uncle and had never had the nerve to use. A digital camera. A notebook. The instincts of a job—assess, plan, execute—clicked into place, but the job had changed. He wasn’t fixing a leak anymore. He was following one. To its source.

He drove through the darkening evening, back towards the river. Not to the *Meridian*. That was the wound. He needed to find the infection.

He parked three streets over, in the shadow of a closed mechanic’s shop. He pulled on a dark jacket, shoved the tools into a small rucksack. The city at night was a different beast. The sodium lights cast a sickly orange pall, creating pools of glare and deep, impenetrable shadow. The tenements were watchful, blind eyes in their faces.

He had a name. Only one, from all those pages. The name signed at the bottom of the final, damning ledger. The director who had overseen the last years of the trade. A name written in the same neat, bureaucratic hand as the entries for the dead and the disappeared.

**Dr. A. S. Lockhart.**

He didn’t know who that was. But Glasgow is a village of bricks and mortar. And a man with a title, a doctor, who ran a place like the *Meridian*… he would have left a trace. A house. A reputation. A stone with his name on it.

Donnie started walking, his body protesting every step. He wasn’t a detective. He was a man with a sore face and a head full of ghosts. But he knew buildings. He knew how they held their secrets. And he knew the city. Its geography was a ledger of its own.

He found it in the Mitchell Library the next morning, his face partly hidden by the hood of his jacket. He looked through old street directories on microfiche, the green glow making his eyes ache. 1965. *Meridian Mortuary & Medical Institute. Director: Dr. Alistair S. Lockhart.* An address for the institution. And a private address: **17 Kirn Street, Hyndland.**

A doctor living in Hyndland. Of course. The respectable west end. Tree-lined streets, sandstone villas, a world away from the greasy rain of the Gallowgate. The money from the dead and the stolen had bought quiet and distance.

Kirn Street was still there. He circled it that evening, a phantom in a rusted Vauxhall. Number 17 was a substantial, double-fronted villa, detached, behind a high wall of dark rhododendron bushes. It was not derelict. It was impeccably maintained. The sandstone was clean, the windows were double-glazed, the garden was neat. But it had a still, watchful quality. No lights shone, though it was fully dark. A FOR SALE sign stood by the wrought-iron gate, the agent’s board looking new, pristine.

Lyle’s clients. Redeveloping the *Meridian*. Selling off the director’s house. Tying up loose ends.

This was the other half. He felt it in his bones, the same way he’d felt the wrongness in the roof. The story wasn’t in the grand, weeping institution. It was here, in this quiet, wealthy silence. Lockhart had taken his secrets home. They would be in the walls, the floorboards, the safe behind a painting. The counterpart to the ledger.

He had to get inside.

The plan was madness. He was one man, bruised and tired, against a system that had already shown it would use violence. But the hollow feeling was gone. Replaced by a cold, focused rage. They had taken the satchel. They had taken his dignity. They thought the story was over.

He waited until two in the morning. The street was asleep. The only sound was the distant hum of the motorway. He approached the wall at the side of the property, where the shadows were deepest. The rhododendrons were thick, their waxy leaves cold and wet. He used the crowbar to gain purchase, hauled himself up, and dropped into the garden, the impact sending a jolt through his ribs. He crouched, listening. Nothing.

The back of the house was darker. A conservatory, modern addition. The lock on the door was a standard Yale. His hands were trembling, but not from fear. From a kind of furious energy. He fumbled with the picks, the tiny tools feeling alien in his rough hands. It took ten long minutes, each second stretching out, the back of his neck prickling. Then, a click. Smooth, silent.

He was in.

The air was cold, stale, smelling of polish and emptiness. He flicked on the flashlight, its beam cutting a swath through the dark. The kitchen was a showroom—unused, perfect. The living room was the same. Furniture under dust sheets, like shrouds. The house was a mortuary for a life.

He moved room by room, his heart a drum in his ears. He didn’t know what he was looking for. A study. A desk. A safe. The house felt dead, but it was a watching dead. His beam caught photographs on a mantelpiece, draped in cloth. He lifted a corner. A severe-looking man in Victorian garb glared out. Lockhart’s father, grandfather. A dynasty of respectability.

He found the study on the first floor. A heavy oak door. Locked. This lock was older, tougher. He worked at it, sweat beading on his forehead despite the chill. The crowbar was too loud. He had to be a ghost.

Finally, the mechanism yielded with a groan that sounded like a shout in the silent house. He froze, listening. Only his own breath.

The study was a time capsule. A large, leather-topped desk. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves filled with medical texts, their spines cracked with age. An antique globe. Donnie went to the desk. The drawers were locked. He used the crowbar now, a quick, brutal jerk. The wood splintered with a sound like a gunshot.

The drawer was empty save for one thing. A small, brass key. It felt warm in his cold hand.

He turned, his beam sweeping the room. Where? A painting. A landscape of the Highlands, gloomy and dark. He lifted it from the wall. Behind it, set into the plaster, was a small, black safe door. The key fit. The door swung open.

No stacks of cash. No jewels. Just papers. Neat, bundled files. And a single, leather-bound book, smaller than the ledgers from the roof, but of similar vintage.

He took it to the desk, sat in the high-backed leather chair, and opened it.

It was not a ledger of the dead. It was a ledger of the living. Of payments received. Client codes. Sums in guineas. References to “the Edinburgh agreement,” “the Canadian arrangement.” Initials. And names. Not the names of the dead, but the names of the powerful. Lawyers. Councillors. A reverend. A name that made his blood freeze: a man who was now a knight of the realm, a philanthropist whose name was on a wing of the Royal Infirmary.

This was the counterpart. This was what Lyle was protecting. Not just a grim history, but a living network. The *Meridian* had been the machine. Lockhart had been the mechanic. And the city’s pillars had been the beneficiaries. Secrets buried, problems disappeared, all for a fee. The child taken from the young woman… she had been a “problem.” Her child, a “commodity.” The ledgers on the roof were the intake. This book was the accounts receivable.

He took the camera. He photographed every page. The flash was a shocking burst of light in the dark room. He worked methodically, his hands steady now. He bundled the original papers back into the safe, locked it, replaced the painting. He took the brass key and threw it far into the rhododendron bushes outside the window.

He had it. The truth, the whole, rotten, connected truth. It was in his camera. A digital ghost of the original.

He left the house as he had entered, a shadow among shadows. The night felt different. The air was charged. He had turned the tide. He had the tool.

But as he drove away, the first cold sliver of dawn bleeding into the sky over the cathedral, he knew the cost. He was no longer just a man who fixed leaks. He was a man who knew. And knowing, in this city, was a target painted on your back. Lyle would know the house had been breached. They would come looking. For the camera. For him.

He had achieved a victory. He had the key to bring it all down. But he had stepped out of the world of small, fixable things and into the dark, flowing river of the city’s oldest, coldest secrets. And he was swimming alone.

He pulled up outside his flat. The street was quiet. His hand went to the camera, solid and heavy in his pocket. Proof.

He looked up at his dark window. And saw, parked fifty yards down the street, a familiar grey van.

They were already here.

# Chapter 7

## **CHAPTER 7**

The grey van was the colour of a dead sky. It sat under a busted streetlamp, its windscreen a blank, dark eye. Donnie kept his hands on the wheel, the engine idling with a tired rattle. The camera was a brick of cold plastic and metal against his thigh. Proof. It felt less like a key now, and more like a live wire, humming with a current that would burn anyone who touched it.

He’d left the cathedral district behind, driven through streets still sleeping off the night, and this was his welcome home. No theatrics. No black cars with tinted windows. A grey van. The kind plumbers or electricians used. The kind that could park anywhere and be invisible. Lyle’s men weren’t police. They didn’t need to make a show. They just needed to be a fact.

He drove past his close. He didn’t slow, didn’t turn his head. He took the next right, then a left, working his way through the backstreets of Dennistoun without conscious thought. His mind was a cold, clear pane. They were at his flat. They would be inside. Waiting. Or they’d have been and gone, leaving a listening ear in the lampshade, a silent eye in the smoke alarm. It didn’t matter. He couldn’t go back.

The reward. He had it. It was sitting in his pocket, and it had made him a ghost in his own life.

He needed a place to develop the film. The thought was a dry, ironic crack in his mind. There was no film. It was all ones and zeroes trapped in the camera’s gut. He needed to get it out, to see it on something other than the tiny, glowing screen. He needed to make it real, to multiply it. One copy was a secret. Two was insurance. A hundred was a war.

He thought of Moira’s. The cluttered back office of her charity shop, with the old desktop computer that whined like a distressed animal when it booted up. She owed him. He’d fixed a leak in her stockroom last winter, a persistent damp that was warping the biographies and the romance novels. He’d taken a twenty and a cup of tea for the job. She’d called him a saint. He’d told her saints didn’t charge.

It was too early. The shop wouldn’t open for hours. He needed somewhere to sit, to let the night finish bleeding out of the world.

He found himself down by the river, where the water was the colour of lead, churning under the gantries of the Squinty Bridge. He parked in the shadow of a warehouse that smelled of rust and old grain. The first proper light of day was a thin, grudging line over the hills to the east, not yet strong enough to warm the stone. He took the camera, connected it to his laptop with the cable he kept in the glovebox. He copied the files. The progress bar crept across the screen, a tiny, digital march. When it was done, he uploaded the lot to a cloud storage account he’d set up years ago and never used. He typed in an email address he hadn’t thought of in a decade: his sister’s, down in Manchester. She was a primary school teacher. Lived a life of playground duty and marking spelling tests. He attached the files, wrote a subject line: *Holiday Photos - Don’t open, just keep safe for me*. He hit send. The files vanished into the ether, a ghost shipment.

He deleted the history, wiped the cache. The laptop was clean. The camera was still the original. He took the memory card out, held it between his finger and thumb. A sliver of plastic and silicon that held the names of the dead and the damned. He slipped it into a fold of his wallet.

The reward was secured. Possession was taken. He felt no triumph. Only a hollow, ringing space where his stomach should have been.

***

The charity shop smelled of dust and lavender polish. Moira was a woman built from soft angles and hard eyes, her hair a cloud of grey perm. She took one look at Donnie’s face, pale under the strip lights, and didn’t ask questions. She just nodded towards the back.

“Computer’s on. Kettle’s just boiled. You look like you could use a brew that’s stronger than tea.”

“I’m all right, Moira.”

“You’re not. But you’re here. Back room’s yours. I’ll mind the shop.”

He sat at the old desk, surrounded by boxes of unsorted bric-a-brac—chipped figurines, stacks of old *People’s Friend* magazines, a bin bag full of mismatched gloves. The computer groaned to life. He inserted the memory card, opened the files. The photographs filled the screen, one after another, in brutal clarity. The flash had bleached the old paper white, making the spidery handwriting stand out like scars.

He scrolled. Names. Dates. Amounts. Descriptions that were clinical in their horror. *Item: male infant, 6lbs. Disposition: private adoption, Surrey. Fee: £15,000. Client: Lockhart, for consortium.* Another: *Item: female, 16. Disposition: maritime service. Fee: £8,000. Client: A. Renfrew (per L.)* Maritime service. The *Meridian*.

He printed them. The printer was an ancient laserjet that shuddered and whined, spitting out page after page of damning evidence. The sound was like a steady, mechanical heartbeat. He made two sets. He folded one set into a thick A4 envelope, sealed it. The other he kept loose.

Moira came in with two mugs. She set one down beside him. It was black coffee, a finger of whisky visible on the surface. She glanced at the printout in front of him, at the word *Meridian*. Her face didn’t change, but something in her eyes shut down, like a portcullis dropping.

“That’s a bad word, Donnie.”

“You know it?”

“I know of it. My cousin’s boy. He was a good lad. Got in with a bad crowd. One night he… didn’t come home. They found him a week later, washed up at Greenock. The polis said it was an accident. Fell in the river after a skinful. But he couldn’t swim. He was terrified of the water.” She took a sip of her own tea. “There were whispers. About a ship that took boys for… work. The *Meridian*. You didn’t hear it from me.”

Donnie looked at the page. *Maritime service.* “I’m sorry, Moira.”

“What are you going to do with that?”

“I don’t know yet.”

“Well,” she said, picking a stray thread from her cardigan. “Whoever you’re after with that… they’re not men. They’re a condition. Like the damp. They get in the walls.”

He drank the coffee. The whisky was a cheap burn, but it grounded him. A small, human warmth against the cold facts on the desk. This was his team. Moira and her silent, grim understanding. A celebration of sorts. A quiet acknowledgement that the thing was real, and that he had it. But the cost was there, sitting between them on the cluttered desk. Her cousin’s boy. The young woman from the ledger. A thousand ghosts, leaning in to look at their names.

“I need a favour,” he said. “This envelope. Can you post it for me? From a box across town. Today.”

She took it. It was heavy. “Where to?”

“The *Herald*. Investigations desk. No return address.”

She nodded, tucking it into a bag of donations waiting to be sorted. “It’ll be gone within the hour.”

He left the shop with the loose set of papers in a Tesco bag for life, the camera around his neck under his jacket. The morning had properly broken, a weak, washed-out sun doing nothing to lift the chill. He felt exposed. The brief, tempered solidarity of Moira’s back room was gone. He was back in the open, carrying the contagion.

***

He called Tam from a payphone outside a closed bookies. The sound of the pips was a nostalgic dread.

“It’s me.”

“Christ, Donnie. Where are you? There’s been… visitors. At the yard. Two fellas in nice coats. Asking for you. Polite. Too polite.”

“Lyle’s men.”

“I figured. They said they were from a corporate security firm. Doing background checks for a contract. I told them you were on a job up north. They didn’t believe me.” Tam’s voice dropped. “They went through your locker, Donnie. Took your time sheets. They knew what they were looking for.”

“They’re looking for a camera.”

“What have you got yourself into?”

“The truth, Tam. The real, fucking ugly truth.” He leaned his forehead against the cold metal of the phone box. “They’ll be watching you now. Your phone, maybe your flat. You need to be careful.”

“Careful? I’m a plumber with a dodgy knee. What do they want with me?”

“They want me. And you’re a thread that leads to me. I’m sorry. I never meant to pull you into this.”

Tam was silent for a moment. Donnie could hear the faint hiss of his kettle in the background. The ordinary world, straining at the seams. “You’ve got it, then? The thing you were after?”

“Aye.”

“And is it… is it worth it?”

Donnie looked out at the street. A young mother was wrestling a buggy onto a bus. An old man was walking a terrier that paused to sniff at every lamppost. The ordinary world. “It has to be.”

“Right,” Tam said, the word heavy with finality. “Well. You know where I am. If you need… I don’t know. A wrench thrown in the works.”

It was the closest Tam would get to a declaration of loyalty. It was a celebration, of a kind. A brief, grim toast over a crackling line. But the loss was there, unspoken. The yard was compromised. Their partnership, their simple world of blocked pipes and faulty boilers, was over. The cost was counted in the silence between them.

“Lay low, Tam. Act normal. I’ll be in touch when I can.”

He hung up before Tam could reply. The celebration was over. The antagonist’s forces weren’t just regrouping; they were already in his city, at his friend’s door, moving with a quiet, professional certainty. The reward hadn’t ended the game. It had just changed the board.

***

He needed to move. But a man alone, with a target on his back, was easy prey. He needed to become something else. He went to a Cash Converters in Partick and sold the camera. It was a risk, but the memory card was safe, the files were multiplied. The camera itself was now a liability, a beacon. He took the hundred and twenty pounds in grubby notes, bought a cheap pay-as-you-go mobile from the display case next to the till.

His next stop was a library. He used a public terminal, logged into his cloud account. He downloaded the files onto a USB stick he bought from a newsagent. Then he went to a different library, across the river, and did the same. He was seeding the truth, scattering it like bitter seed in sterile soil. It felt better than having it all in one place. It felt like a fight.

By late afternoon, the adrenaline had burned off, leaving a fine, metallic ash of exhaustion in its place. He was hungry, but the thought of food turned his stomach. He was a man who knew. And knowing was a weight that bent the spine. He found himself in Kelvingrove Park, sitting on a bench facing the art gallery. The sandstone was golden in the slanting light, a picture of civic pride. One of the names in the ledger—Sir Malcolm Caird—had his name on a plaque by the new east wing. A benefactor.

Donnie took out the loose papers, leafed through them. He wasn’t looking for details now. He was looking for a pattern, a weakness. Lockhart was the hub, but the clients… they were the pillars. Judges. Businessmen. A retired chief constable. A surgeon. Their payments weren’t for services rendered; they were investments. Payments for a silence that had been kept, for a problem that had been removed from their path. They had bought their peace, their knighthoods, their wings on hospitals, with other people’s lives.

This was the new danger. It wasn’t just Lyle. It was the city itself. The respectable face of it. The reward he had taken wasn’t just a weapon against one man; it was a lit match held to the entire, rotten foundation. And foundations, when they burned, tended to collapse on everyone standing nearby.

He saw the grey van then. It was idling on the road that curved through the park, fifty yards away. Same van. Or its twin. It wasn’t approaching. It was just watching. A reminder. *We are a condition. We are in the walls.*

The decision crystallised, cold and sharp. He couldn’t stay. He couldn’t go home. He couldn’t lead Lyle to Tam or Moira. The Inmost Cave—the hidden truth at the heart of the city—had been breached. Now he had to flee it, begin the journey back. But there was no ordinary world to go back to. His had been erased the moment he’d opened that safe.

He gathered the papers, put them back in the plastic bag. He stood up, his joints stiff. He walked away from the bench, not hurrying, not looking back. He could feel the van’s dark eye on him. He left the park, merged with the crowds on Argyle Street. He bought a cheap rucksack from a sports shop, a change of clothes from a charity shop—jeans, a plain black jumper, a waterproof jacket. He went into the public toilets at Central Station, changed in a cubicle. He balled up his old clothes, shoved them in a bin. Donnie McCallum, the plumber, the leak-fixer, was discarded. He didn’t know who he was now.

He bought a ticket. Not a plan, just a direction. South. The next train to Carlisle, then connections onward. To where, he didn’t know. Manchester, maybe. His sister. She had the ghost of the files in her email. She was an anchor, however faint, to a life before.

He stood on the platform, the rucksack at his feet. The station air was thick with diesel and echoes. The train hissed and sighed like a great beast. He was leaving. He had the reward. He had paid the cost. He was swimming alone in the dark river, and the current was pulling him out to sea.

As he boarded, finding a seat by a window, he saw two men in dark jackets walking purposefully along the platform, their eyes scanning the carriages. They weren’t looking for him. They were looking for a man in a workman’s jacket, with a tradesman’s stoop. They passed his window without a glance.

The train pulled out, the city beginning to slide past the glass—the tenements, the cranes, the cathedral on its hill, black against the greying sky. He had the proof. He had fled the cave. But as the last of the city’s skyline vanished behind a curve of track, he knew one thing with absolute, cold certainty.

They wouldn’t stop looking. And the proof he carried wasn’t a shield. It was the only thing keeping him alive. The moment he tried to use it, to bring it into the light, was the moment they would have to silence him for good. The journey back was just a longer, darker road into the same night. He was carrying the infection, and he was contagious.

# Chapter 8

## **CHAPTER 8**

The train south was a metal lung, breathing in the damp Scottish borders and exhaling it over the sodden fields of Cumbria. Donnie watched it all blur past—the skeletal trees, the stone dykes, the sheep huddled like dirty clouds in the lee of hills. The world outside the glass was a watercolour left in the rain, all its colours bleeding into one grey wash. He kept his hands on his knees, the rucksack between his feet. The proof was in there, wrapped in a plastic bag from a station kiosk, inside a hollowed-out library book he’d lifted from a charity shop bin. A history of the Clyde shipyards. No one would look there.

The man across the aisle was snoring, his head lolling against the window. A woman two rows up was peeling an orange, the citrus sting cutting through the smell of wet wool and stale breath. Ordinary people. Donnie felt like a specimen behind glass, something that didn’t belong in the ecosystem. He was the infection. He was moving through the bloodstream of the ordinary world, and sooner or later, the white cells would find him.

He changed at Carlisle. A different kind of cold here, a flat, English cold that seeped in under the platform roofs. He bought a weak tea from a trolley, sipped it scalding hot, felt it burn a path down to his hollow gut. He watched the boards flicker. Manchester Piccadilly. Platform Four. He merged with the shuffling queue, kept his head down, his shoulders doing that old, familiar hunch. Not armour. Camouflage.

The train to Manchester was busier, louder. Students with oversized headphones, a couple arguing in low, sharp tones about a mother-in-law, a businessman tapping a silent fury into his laptop. Donnie found a seat near the doors. He put the rucksack on the empty seat beside him, a feeble barrier. He stared at his reflection in the darkening window—a pale face floating over the rushing shadows of pylons and industrial estates. Donnie McCallum, the plumber, was in a bin at Central Station. The man in the window was a ghost with a library book and a sister he hadn’t spoken to in eighteen months.

He must have dozed. The jolt of the train braking into a station snapped him awake, heart hammering against his ribs. Oxenholme. The doors hissed open, a gust of wet wind invading the warm carriage. Two men got on.

They weren’t in dark jackets. One wore a sensible waxed coat, green. The other a navy puffa. They moved with the slight weariness of travellers, scanning for seats. Their eyes passed over him. But something in the way the one in green paused, his gaze lingering for a half-second on the rucksack on the seat, sent a needle of ice into Donnie’s spine. It was the pause of a man checking a list. A hunter recognising a shape, not a face.

*They’re adapting*, he thought. They weren’t just looking for a workman’s jacket anymore. They were looking for a man alone, a man trying not to be seen, a man with a cheap, new rucksack guarding the space beside him like it held the crown jewels. He’d made himself a silhouette. And silhouettes are easy to spot.

He stood up, hefting the rucksack. The movement was too sudden. The man in green glanced up. Donnie walked, not towards the toilets, but down the carriage, through the connecting doors, into the next car. The train was moving again, gathering speed. He kept walking, car after car, the rhythm of the wheels a frantic drumbeat now. *Not yet, not yet, not yet.*

He reached the quiet carriage. The silence here was a taut wire. He slid into a seat by the window, placed the rucksack on his lap. He watched the reflection in the glass behind him. For three minutes, nothing. Then the door at the far end of the carriage opened. The man in the waxed coat. He didn’t look left or right. He just started walking down the aisle, his eyes on the reflections in the windows, hunting for the reflection that would flinch.

Donnie stood. There was only one direction. Forward. Through the next set of doors, into the vestibule, the roar of the wheels louder here, a metallic scream. The door to the next carriage was locked. Out of service. A dead end.

He turned. The man in the waxed coat was in the vestibule with him, pulling the door closed behind him. He wasn’t big. He had the calm, composed face of a pharmacist or a mid-level council officer. His hands were empty.

“Donald,” the man said. His voice was mild, almost apologetic. “This is a lot of fuss, isn’t it? For a memory stick.”

Donnie’s back was against the cold metal of the locked door. The rucksack was a dead weight in his arms. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“Course you do. You took something that doesn’t belong to you. My job is to get it back. Your job is to give it to me. Then you get off at the next stop, you go see your sister, you have a nice life. A shorter one, perhaps, but nicer for the lack of running.”

“And if I say no?”

The man smiled. It didn’t touch his eyes. They were the colour of the slate sky outside. “Then you don’t get off the train. You have an accident. A tragic fall. Between the carriages. It happens.” He took a step closer. The train swayed, throwing them together for an instant. Donnie smelled soap, and underneath it, something sterile, like surgical spirit. “You’re a sensible man, Donald. You fixed leaks. This is a leak. You’re holding the spill. Just hand it over. Let us contain it.”

Donnie’s mind was a white, roaring static. The proof. His life. The only thing keeping him alive. The man was right. The moment he tried to use it, they’d kill him. But the moment he gave it up, they’d kill him anyway. He was a witness. The leak wasn’t on the memory stick; it was in his head.

The man read his face. The mildness vanished, replaced by a flat, professional impatience. “Right. Have it your way.”

His hand went inside his waxed coat. Donnie didn’t wait to see what it came out with. He swung the rucksack, hard and low. It wasn’t a fighter’s move. It was a labourer’s move, a swing of something heavy and awkward. The corner of the library book inside connected with the man’s knee. There was a grunt, more surprise than pain. Donnie shoved past him, yanked open the carriage door, stumbled back into the quiet carriage. Eyes looked up from books, from laptops, annoyed at the disturbance.

“He’s not well!” Donnie shouted, pointing back at the vestibule. “He needs help!”

He didn’t wait to see if anyone moved. He ran, crashing back through the train, a bull in a china shop of calm. He heard a raised voice behind him, a commotion starting. He’d bought seconds.

He burst into the carriage where he’d started. The businessman looked up, irritated. The snoring man snorted awake. Donnie’s eyes went to the emergency stop cord. A red handle behind glass. A chaos of braking, alarms, questions. A chance to disappear in the stoppage. But it would pinpoint him. It would be a flare shot into the sky.

He saw the other one, Puffa Jacket, standing by the doors at the far end, watching his approach. A pincer. They had him.

Then he saw the sign, flashing past on the outside. A white circle on blue. **Preston. 2 min.**

The train was already slowing. A scheduled stop. A gift.

He changed his grip on the rucksack, holding it like a rugby ball. The businessman was standing now, blocking the aisle, his laptop held like a shield. “Here, what’s this—”

Donnie went over the seats. He vaulted the backrest, landed in the next row, stumbled, kept going. He was a leak, flowing through the obstacles, finding the path of least resistance. Puffa Jacket was moving towards him, fast now, no pretence.

The brakes squealed. The platform lights of Preston station slid into view, bleary in the rain.

Donnie hit the door button. It didn’t open. Not until the train stopped. He stood there, his back to the door, facing the carriage. Puffa Jacket was ten feet away, closing. Behind him, at the other end, Waxed Coat appeared, his hair slightly dishevelled, his expression no longer mild. It was cold, clean fury.

The train stopped with a final sigh. The doors hissed open.

Donnie fell backwards onto the platform. He scrambled up, ran. He didn’t look back. He heard the shout, the pounding of feet on the wet concrete. He weaved through a clot of passengers, around a trolley of parcels, through a cloud of steam from a catering trolley.

The station was a canyon of noise and light. He hit the concourse, his eyes scanning the signs. Exits. Taxis. Buses. Stairs. He took the stairs, two at a time, down into an underpass. The sound of his own breathing was a bellows in his ears. The footsteps behind him were echoes, multiplying.

The underpass was a long, tiled throat, lit by harsh fluorescent strips. At the far end, stairs up to another platform. Halfway down, a recessed doorway. Staff Only.

He didn’t break stride. He hit the door with his shoulder. It gave, cheap lock snapping. He fell into a dark, narrow space smelling of damp mops and disinfectant. A janitor’s closet. He slammed the door shut, plunged into utter blackness. He fumbled, found a bolt, slid it home.

He stood in the dark, his forehead against the cold metal of the door, sucking air in ragged, painful gulps. Outside, the footsteps skidded to a halt. Muffled voices.

“Where’d he go?”
“Down here. Has to be.”
“Check the doors.”

A hand rattled the handle of his door. Donnie stopped breathing. The rattling stopped. He heard the footsteps move on, fading up the stairs at the end of the tunnel.

He didn’t move. He counted to a hundred. Then to two hundred. The only sound was the drip of a tap into a metal sink and the distant, subterranean rumble of a train.

The proof was a hard rectangle against his chest, inside his jacket now. He’d transferred it in the darkness. The rucksack was just a decoy. A sack of dirty clothes and a library book with no history left in it.

He waited an hour. Maybe two. Time was a pool of oil in the dark. Then he unbolted the door, cracked it open. The underpass was empty. He slipped out, walked, not ran, up the stairs to the other platform. A different line. Liverpool. He bought a ticket from a machine with cash. He boarded a train that was about to leave. He sat, anonymous, among a new set of strangers.

He got off at a small, unremarkable station just outside Liverpool. A place of takeaways and taxi offices, the rain here was a proper English drizzle, soft and persistent. He found a pub that took cash for a room. It was above the bar, a box with a sagging bed and a window that looked out onto a wet car park and the neon sign of a kebab shop. The room smelled of old smoke and fried food. It was a tomb. It was perfect.

He lay on the bed, the proof a cold brand over his heart. The chase had begun. The first obstacle was passed. He was still alive. But he was down to just the clothes he wore, a handful of notes, and a piece of plastic that was a death sentence. He had reached a safe haven, if you could call it that. A temporary berth in a forgotten port.

He pulled the thin curtain aside. Down in the car park, a man was arguing with a taxi driver. A woman walked a small, yapping dog. A kid on a bike skidded through a puddle. The ordinary world. It was right there, through the glass. He could see it, could almost hear its mundane music. The argument over a fare, the yap of the dog, the splash of the puddle.

It was within reach. A life. His sister’s flat in Manchester, a cup of tea, a conversation that didn’t involve memory sticks or men with quiet voices and surgical smells. An anchor.

He let the curtain fall back. The room was dark again. The neon from the kebab sign pulsed through the fabric—a rhythmic, bloody glow.

The anchor was there. But to reach it, he’d have to swim through the dark river again. And he knew now, with a certainty that was colder than the Preston platform, that he couldn’t bring the infection to her doorstep. The proof was his burden, his curse. To get to the ordinary world, he would have to sacrifice the very thing that had kept him alive this long. He would have to let it go. Not to them. But to someone else. Someone who could use it as a weapon, not a shield.

He had the name. The journalist. The one who’d written the piece about the council contracts, years back. The one who asked questions that went unanswered. Fraser. Kat Fraser.

He would have to post the infection to her. And hope it killed the disease, and not the doctor.

He sat up in the dark. The journey back was a longer, darker road. And he had just reached the point where the road forked. One path led to his sister, and his own quiet end. The other led to a woman he’d never met, and a storm he would unleash upon her.

Down in the car park, the taxi drove away. The man was left standing alone in the rain, shoulders hunched against it. A futile, instinctive armour.

Donnie reached for the rucksack, for the pen and the pad of paper he’d stolen from the train. He had a letter to write. And then he had to find a post office that didn’t have eyes in the walls.

# Chapter 9

## **CHAPTER 9**

The post office on Sauchiehall Street was a temple of the ordinary. Fluorescent light bleached the linoleum to the colour of old bone. A queue of three people, each holding a parcel like a fragile offering, shuffled forward with the weary patience of cattle. The air smelled of damp carpet and cheap perfume. Donnie stood just inside the door, the rucksack heavy against his spine, watching the woman behind the counter. She had a kind face, tired around the eyes, and she was explaining international postage rates to a student with a meticulous, gentle slowness. This was the machinery of the mundane world, grinding on. A letter, a stamp, a postmark. It was how things got from A to B.

His own parcel was a padded envelope, bought from a newsagent two streets over. Inside it, wrapped in three layers of greaseproof paper from a chippy, was the memory stick. And beneath it, the letter. He hadn’t known how to start. In the end, he’d just begun.

*Ms. Fraser,*

*You don’t know me. My name is Donnie McCallum. If you’re reading this, I’m probably dead. Or I wish I was. The thing attached is a sickness. It’s a record of a sickness in men, the kind that gets dressed in a suit and talks about procurement and urban renewal. It’s about the Riverside. It’s about how they clean up the messes they make. It’s names, dates, bank accounts. It’s the smell of Old Spice and surgical spirit. I’m posting it to you because I can’t carry it anymore, and I can’t let it die with me. Use it as a weapon. Don’t let it be a shield. I’m sorry.*

*D.*

He hadn’t signed his full name. Just the initial. It felt like chiselling his own initial on a headstone.

The student moved away, clutching a receipt. The queue shifted. One person left. An old man posting a birthday card. Donnie’s turn was next. The fluorescent hum was a physical pressure against his skull. He could feel the envelope through the fabric of the rucksack, a hard, cold rectangle against his kidney. His infection. His curse. To hand it over was to cut it out of himself. It would leave a hole, but the poison would be gone. He could go to Manchester then. He could sit in his sister’s kitchen and the silence would just be silence, not a held breath.

The old man finished. The kind-faced woman looked up, her smile a professional reflex. “Next, please.”

Donnie took a step forward. The linoleum seemed to tilt under his feet. This was it. The threshold. He swung the rucksack off his shoulder, the zip loud in the quiet room.

The door behind him opened with a gust of wet, diesel-scented air. A man entered, shaking rain from a dark overcoat. Donnie didn’t turn. He kept his eyes on the woman, his hands on the bag’s zip. But the air in the room changed. The fluorescent hum didn’t just sound like pressure; it felt like a held note, a string tuned too tight.

The man didn’t join the queue. He stood to the side, by the display of first-class stamp books, and began to slowly unbutton his coat. He was methodical about it. A man with time.

Donnie knew the rhythm of that stillness. He’d felt it on the platform at Preston. He’d smelled it in the back of the car. His fingers froze on the zip-pull. He didn’t need to see the face. The presence was enough—a cold spot in the room, a silence within the silence.

The woman behind the counter was looking past him, at the new arrival, her polite smile fading into a mild question. “Can I help you, sir?”

“Just waiting,” the man said. His voice was calm, mid-level. The voice of a man discussing a minor account discrepancy. It was the voice from the car. The one who’d asked about the memory stick. The one who smelled of surgical spirit.

Donnie’s blood turned to slurry in his veins. They hadn’t lost him. They’d herded him. The post office wasn’t a temple; it was a pen. The ordinary world on Sauchiehall Street was just a painting on the wall, and he’d walked right up to it, thinking he could step through.

He slowly zipped the rucksack back up. The sound was a confession.

“Everything alright?” the woman asked, her attention returning to him.

“Forgot the address,” Donnie muttered, his own voice thick. He hoisted the bag back onto his shoulder. The weight was different now. It was no longer a burden he was about to relinquish. It was a lodestone, dragging him down into the dark river. He turned.

The man by the stamps was looking directly at him. He was in his fifties, with a face that was neither kind nor cruel, but finished. Like a door that had been closed and painted shut. His hair was steel-grey, cut close. His overcoat was good quality, dry-cleaned. He didn’t smile. He just gave a small, almost imperceptible nod towards the door. *After you.*

Donnie walked. His legs were blocks of wood. Each step towards the door was a step away from the fluorescent sanctuary, back into the greasy smear of the rain. He pushed the door open, the bell jangling a cheap, cheerful note.

The street was busy with lunchtime traffic, people with umbrellas and shopping bags, laughter from a pub doorway. The ordinary world. It surged around him, a current he could not join. The man followed him out, a pace behind and to the left. A shepherd.

“Keep walking,” the man said, the words barely moving his lips. “Turn left at the corner. There’s a car.”

Donnie kept walking. The rain needled his face. He saw the young lad from the Gallowgate again in his mind, shoulders hunched around his ears. A futile, instinctive armour. He’d perfected it himself, years ago. But armour was for hiding. He was done hiding.

At the corner, he didn’t turn left. He stopped. He turned to face the man.

The man stopped too, a flicker of annoyance crossing the finished face. “The car,” he repeated, a hint of steel in the calm voice.

“No,” Donnie said. The word came out flat, final. It wasn’t a shout. It was a stone dropped into a well.

The man’s eyes narrowed, just a fraction. He assessed Donnie not as a person, but as a problem to be recalculated. “McCallum. You’ve run your race. Get in the car, it goes easier. For you, and for your sister in Manchester.”

The use of the name, the location, was meant to be a hammer-blow. It was. It felt like a crack in his ribs. But the cold that flooded in wasn’t fear. It was clarity. This was the last, desperate attempt. The final lunge from the dark. They were showing him their teeth because they had nothing else left. They couldn’t afford noise, not here. They needed him to come quietly, to disappear into the back of a car, to become another mess cleaned up by the Riverside.

“You don’t get it,” Donnie said, his voice low. “I’m not running anymore. And you can’t make me get in that car.”

The man’s hand moved inside his open overcoat. A subtle, professional movement. Donnie didn’t wait to see what it held. He swung the rucksack off his shoulder, not in panic, but with a grim, deliberate force. He didn’t swing it at the man. He swung it *out*, into the busy stream of pedestrians, and let go.

The bag sailed in a low arc and landed with a thump at the feet of a group of young women, scattering them with a chorus of shrieks and curses. It lay there, a dark lump on the wet pavement.

For a second, everything stopped. The man with the finished face stared, not at Donnie, but at the bag. His calculation had shattered. This was noise. This was a scene.

“My bag!” Donnie shouted, his voice cutting through the drizzle. “He stole my bag!”

He pointed at the man in the overcoat.

A hundred eyes turned. The world, the ordinary, busy, mundane world, focused its attention. A man in a good coat, caught in the act. The young women were staring, indignant. A burly guy in a high-vis jacket stopped. “Here, what’s this?”

The man in the overcoat didn’t fluster. He looked from the bag to Donnie to the gathering ring of faces. His expression settled into one of cold, pure contempt. Not for the crowd, but for Donnie. For the sheer, messy unpredictability of it. This wasn’t how things were done. He took one step back, then another, melting backwards with a terrifying grace.

“He’s getting away!” the burly man shouted, but his voice was unsure. The man in the overcoat was already turning, already merging with the crowd, a shadow dissolving into the grey afternoon.

Donnie didn’t watch him go. He pushed forward, through the ring of people. “Sorry, sorry, it’s alright,” he mumbled, scooping up the rucksack. It was damp from the pavement. He clutched it to his chest.

“You want the polis, mate?” the burly man asked.

“No,” Donnie said, too quickly. He made himself meet the man’s eyes. “No. Just… got my stuff back. Thanks.”

He backed away, the bag held tight, and then he was moving, not running, but walking fast, his heart hammering a frantic rhythm against the padded envelope inside his jacket. He had cut the infection out. Not by posting it, but by using it as a weapon. He had drawn the darkness into the light, for one blinding second, and it had recoiled.

He walked for an hour, through streets that grew narrower, dirtier, until the crowds thinned and the tenements closed in again. He found himself on a bridge over the Clyde, the water below the colour of lead, churning with secret currents. The rain had softened to a mist. He was alone.

He took the padded envelope from inside his jacket. The memory stick and the letter were still inside. He looked at it, then at the river. This was the fork. The dark road back, or the storm unleashed.

He leaned on the cold iron railing. The letter was a lit fuse. To send it was to hand Kat Fraser a live grenade. It might destroy the disease. It might blow up in her hands. It might simply vanish into the system, swallowed without a trace. He thought of her, a name from a byline, a woman who asked questions that went unanswered. He thought of the kind-faced woman in the post office, of his sister making tea in a quiet kitchen. Of the young lad on the Gallowgate, hunched against the rain.

A life was within reach. But it was a life bought with silence. A life where the infection festered in the dark, where men with finished faces kept cleaning up messes. He had changed. The wisdom he’d gained wasn’t how to hide better. It was that some things couldn’t be outrun. They had to be faced. And if you couldn’t face them alone, you had to pass the fight to someone who could.

He pushed himself upright. He knew a place. A proper old-fashioned newsagent’s, down in Partick, run by an ancient man who still sold individual stamps from a book and asked no questions. It would have to be done right. No tracking, no cameras. Just a stamp, a postbox, a leap of faith.

The mist clung to him as he walked off the bridge, the envelope a hard rectangle in his hand. He was cold, and tired, and he had never felt more clear. The anchor was there. But he would not swim to it dragging this corpse behind him. He would set the corpse adrift, a message in a bottle, and swim for shore.

The newsagent’s was where he remembered it, a cave of paper and tobacco dust. The old man peered at the Manchester address, licked the stamp with a deliberate tongue, and thumped it down with a bony fist. “First class,” he wheezed. “Be there tomorrow.”

Donnie paid in coins. He walked out, the envelope no longer in his possession. He felt the hole where it had been, a raw, clean emptiness. He walked two blocks to a pillar box, its paint blistered and royal red. He held the envelope over the slot. For a second, he saw not Kat Fraser, but the man with the finished face. He saw the cold contempt in his eyes. This was for him. This was the splash back from the dark river.

He let go. He heard it hit the bottom, a soft, final sound.

He stood there for a long time, empty-handed, watching the mist coil around the streetlights. The infection was gone. Posted. Unleashed. He was cleansed. He was a man with nothing left to hide, and therefore nothing left to fear. The antagonist wasn’t a person anymore; it was a system, and he had just introduced a virus into its bloodstream. The battle wasn’t over, but his part in it was. He had proven his change not by winning, but by choosing the right fight, and the right fighter.

He turned and began to walk towards the station. He would buy a ticket to Manchester. He would drink his sister’s tea. The ordinary world was waiting, and for the first time, he believed he might be allowed to step into it.

Back at the pillar box, the mist thickened. Inside its dark belly, among the bills and the birthday cards, the padded envelope lay still. The fuse was lit. And in a quiet office across the city, a man with a finished face placed a calm, deliberate phone call. The subject had deviated from the path. The contingency was now active. The message in the bottle had been posted. But the river had eyes, and the river had long, long arms.

# Chapter 10

## **CHAPTER 10**

The train south was a tin can rattling through a tunnel of haar. It had seeped in from the coast, this fog, a great grey blanket thrown over the Central Belt, smothering the hills and filling the cuts where the railways ran. Donnie watched it stream past the window, featureless and damp. He felt the same. The raw emptiness where the envelope had been was still there, a clean, cold hollow behind his ribs. It wasn’t peace, not exactly. It was the silence after a scream. The ordinary world was on the other side of this fog, waiting. He kept his hands loose on his knees, unclenched. A man with nothing to hide.

He changed at Waverley, the station’s vast, grimy vault echoing with announcements and the scuff of a thousand feet. He bought a ticket to Manchester Piccadilly from a machine that beeped with a tone of profound indifference. He bought a plastic cup of tea from a kiosk. It tasted of steam and cardboard. He drank it all. These were the actions of an ordinary man. He practised them.

The English countryside, when the fog finally shredded, was a flat, green dream. Neat fields, hedgerows, the occasional cluster of houses with roofs like gingerbread. It looked managed, curated. A world away from the weeping granite and the greasy Gallowgate rain. Donnie’s reflection ghosted over it in the train window—a pale face, the lines a little deeper, the eyes a little quieter. He looked like a man coming home from a long illness. Which, he supposed, he was.

Manchester met him with a different wet. A persistent, microscopic drizzle that hung in the air like forgotten breath. It didn’t fall; it simply was. He walked from Piccadilly, his small bag over his shoulder, through streets that were at once familiar and alien. The red brick, the sharp angles of old mills turned into flats, the hum of trams on their lines. It was louder here than Glasgow, a different frequency of life. He followed the map in his head, turning left, right, into a street of Victorian terraces, their small front gardens mostly paved over for cars.

His sister’s house was the one with the blue door. The paint was fresh. A pot of tired geraniums sat on the step, braving it out. He stood before it, the hollow in his chest echoing. This was the shore. He had swum for it. He lifted his hand and knocked.

The door opened and there was Moira, smaller than he remembered, her hair more grey than brown now, pulled back in a practical clasp. She wore an apron printed with sunflowers. For a heartbeat, she just stared, her eyes wide, her hand frozen on the doorframe. Then her face crumpled, not into tears, but into a fierce, familiar intensity.

“Donnie McCallum,” she said, her voice thick. “You took your time.”

“Aye,” he said. “Traffic was hell.”

And then he was in her arms, the smell of laundry powder and roasting chicken enveloping him. She hugged him like she was testing his solidity, like he might be a trick of the light. He hugged her back, feeling the bird-like bones of her shoulders. The hollow in him didn’t fill, but its edges softened, just a little.

“Get in, you’re letting the damp in,” she said, pulling him inside, already bustling, her emotion channeled into motion. The hallway was narrow, warm, lined with photos of her kids—now adults, strangers to him—and a faded print of a highland cow. “I’ve got the kettle on. You’ll have tea. And you’ll eat. You’re all edges.”

He followed her into the small, bright kitchen. It was overwhelmingly clean. The worktops gleamed. A pot simmered on the hob. The window looked onto a long, narrow back garden, a patch of grass, a shed. Ordinary. Profoundly ordinary.

“Sit,” she commanded.

He sat at the small table. She set a mug of tea before him, strong and dark, the way he used to take it. Then she sat opposite, her own mug cradled in her hands, and just looked at him. The bustle was gone. Her eyes were the same as their mother’s, a pale, clear blue that missed nothing.

“You look tired,” she said.

“I am tired.”

“Are you clean?”

“Yes.”

“Are you in trouble?”

He took a sip of the tea. It was perfect. “I was. I might still be. But I’ve done what I can.”

She absorbed this, her gaze steady. She didn’t ask for details. She never had. Her love was a fierce, practical thing; it asked for the headline, not the copy. “You’re here now,” she stated. “That’s what matters. You’ll stay. The spare room’s made up. Gary’s old room.”

“I don’t want to be a burden, Mo.”

“Don’t be daft. You’re family. It’s not a burden, it’s an arrangement. You can fix the latch on the shed. It’s been sticking for a year.”

He almost smiled. The elixir, here, was not a treasure or a secret. It was a sticking shed latch. It was tea in a clean kitchen. It was a sister who asked if you were clean before she asked if you were hungry. He shared it by simply being there, by accepting the mug, by nodding at the mention of the shed. He had brought nothing with him but the absence of a lie. He set it on the table between them, and she accepted it, this strange, negative gift.

He ate the chicken stew. He helped wash up. He went into the garden for a smoke, the Manchester drizzle beading on his jacket. He looked at the shed, its green paint peeling. A neighbour’s cat watched him from a fence post, unimpressed. This was the tangible change. Not a revolution, but a ceasefire. A man, standing in a small garden, contemplating a broken latch. The world had not been saved. But a man had, perhaps, been returned to it.

Later, in the narrow spare room with its single bed and its wallpaper of faint stripes, he lay awake. The sounds were all wrong. The distant growl of a night bus, not the sudden shout from a close. The sigh of central heating, not the rattle of an ill-fitting window frame. The hollow was still there. He had thought posting the envelope would fill it, but it had just carved it out cleaner. He was a man with nothing to hide, and the emptiness of that was vast. He slept fitfully, dreaming of a pillar box that stretched down into infinite dark, his envelope falling forever, making no sound when it landed.

***

The next day was a Tuesday. Moira went to her job at the doctor’s surgery. “Make yourself useful,” she said, kissing his cheek and pointing a finger at the shed. The house was quiet, full of slanting morning light. Donnie drank another tea. He explored the quiet spaces. The living room with its three-piece suite and large TV. The photos on the mantelpiece: Moira’s husband, Ray, gone five years now from a heart attack, smiling in a football strip; her son Gary in graduation robes; her daughter Lisa on her wedding day. A life, documented. A life lived in straight lines, or near enough.

He found the tools in a cupboard under the stairs. A basic hammer, a screwdriver set, a rusty saw. He took them out to the shed. The latch was a simple bolt, rusted into its housing. He worked at it with the screwdriver, scraping, easing. The physicality of it was a relief. A problem with edges. A solution that could be seen. As he worked, the back gate of the neighbouring property opened and an old man emerged, holding a trowel. He had a cap pulled low over his eyes.

“Alright,” the man said, not looking up, beginning to poke at a flowerbed.

“Alright,” Donnie replied.

“Latch gone, has it?”

“Seized.”

“Aye. Damp.” The man dug for a moment. “You Moira’s brother, then.”

It wasn’t a question. Donnie paused, the screwdriver in his hand. “That’s right.”

“Heard you were up. From Glasgow.”

“Aye.”

The man finally looked up. His face was a network of fine lines, his eyes a watery grey. He gave a slow, deliberate nod. “Good to be back with family.”

“It is.”

“She’s a good one, your sister. Looked after Ray right to the end. A good one.” He said it like a verdict. Then he went back to his digging. The conversation was over. Donnie went back to his scraping. The recognition here was not with honours. It was a nod over a fence. An acknowledgement of place. *You are Moira’s brother. You are fixing the latch. You belong here, in this small constellation of relationships and chores.* It was a quiet anointing. He felt its weight, and its fragility.

By the time Moira returned, the latch was working, its action smooth, oiled. She tested it, opening and closing the shed door twice. “See?” she said, satisfied. “Knew you’d be good for something.”

They ate tea together. She talked about her day, the minor dramas of the surgery, a difficult patient, a new computer system. He listened. It was a liturgy of the ordinary. He tried to lose himself in it. But the hollow echoed. He had introduced a virus. He had lit a fuse. The silence from that other world was deafening.

Two days passed in this manner. A routine established itself. He walked to the newsagent’s for a paper. He helped with the shopping. He fixed a dripping tap. He was Donnie, Moira’s brother, back from Glasgow. A man with a past, but isn’t that everyone? The neighbourhood absorbed him with a quiet, British discretion. He began to recognise faces: the woman with the two terriers, the Asian couple who ran the corner shop, the young mothers with prams. His world had shrunk to a few streets, a supermarket, a park with a bowling green. It should have been a relief. It was a kind of cage.

On the third day, the letter came.

It was Moira who brought it in from the mat. “For you,” she said, her voice carefully neutral. She held a small, cream envelope. It was of good quality. His name and address were typed. There was no return mark.

The hollow in his chest became a vacuum. He took it. The paper was thick, expensive. He slit it open with a thumb. A single sheet inside, the same cream stock. Typed, not printed. A message in neat, black courier font.

*Mr. McCallum,*

*A mutual acquaintance suggested you might appreciate an update. The item you posted has been received. The recipient is, understandably, curious. She would value a conversation to provide context. A meeting has been arranged for your convenience.*

*Friday, 11am. The Whitworth Art Gallery. The café.*

*Please come alone. For her safety, and for yours.*

*Yours,*

*A Friend*

There was no signature. The paper smelled of nothing.

Moira was watching him, her arms crossed over her apron. “Trouble?” she asked, the word flat.

“I don’t know,” he said, and it was the truth. The fuse had burned down. This was the spark. But it wasn’t an explosion; it was an invitation to a gallery café. The system wasn’t attacking. It was asking for a conversation. It was colder, more controlled, than he had imagined. He had thrown a stone into the dark river, and the river had sent back a perfectly typed RSVP.

“Is it the police?”

“No. It’s… something else.”

“The something else you left behind?”

He met her eyes. “Aye. But it’s followed me.”

She didn’t flinch. She walked to the kettle, filled it, clicked it on. The domestic roar filled the kitchen. “You’ll have to see it through, then,” she said, her back to him. “You can’t outrun a thing by bringing it to my door. You meet it. You look it in the eye. Then you decide.” She turned. Her face was set, hard with a protectiveness that terrified him. “But you don’t bring it back here, Donnie. Not to this house. You understand? You meet it, and you send it packing.”

He understood. This was the cost of the ordinary world. You had to keep the darkness at the gate. You had to fix the latch. He nodded. “Friday,” he said.

“Right,” she said. She got out two mugs. Her hands were steady. “Well. You’ll need a clean shirt.”

***

The Whitworth Gallery stood in a park, a grand, red-brick Victorian building all arches and windows. The drizzle had lifted, leaving a sky the colour of old dishwater. Donnie arrived at ten-thirty. He wore the clean shirt. He felt exposed, walking across the manicured grass, the bag of his old life feeling heavier than ever. He was a message in a bottle, washed up and waiting to be read.

He didn’t go straight in. He circled. He watched the entrance. Students with backpacks, older couples, a few tourists. No one who looked like the man with the finished face. No one who looked like Kat Fraser. He felt like a man standing on a minefield, waiting for the click.

At five to eleven, he went inside. The air changed to a hushed, climate-controlled stillness. Light poured through high windows onto polished floors. He found the café, a bright, airy space with glass walls looking into the park. It was half-full. His eyes scanned the tables.

And there she was.

Not as he remembered her from the news photos, which were all sharp suits and sharper smiles. She was at a corner table, her back to the wall, facing the room. She wore a simple navy sweater, jeans. Her hair was darker, longer, tied back. She looked younger, and utterly weary. She was stirring a cup of tea, her gaze fixed on the spoon going around and around. She was alone.

He walked over. The hollow in him was now a roaring tunnel. He stopped at her table. She looked up.

Her eyes were the shock. In the photos, they’d been bright, campaigning. Now they were the colour of a winter sea, and just as cold. They held a knowledge that had scoured them out.

“Kat Fraser,” he said.

“Donnie McCallum,” she replied. Her voice was low, educated, with a faint Edinburgh lilt she hadn’t lost. It held no warmth, but no hostility either. It was pure assessment. “Sit down.”

He sat. A waitress appeared. He asked for a coffee. The mundane ritual played out. When the waitress left, they were alone again in the gentle hum of the café.

“You got my package,” he said.

“I did.” She took a sip of her tea. Her hands were steady, but he saw a fine tremor in her fingers as she set the cup down. “It was… comprehensive.”

“Is it enough?”

“To confirm what I already suspected? Yes. To do anything about it?” She gave a small, bitter twist of her mouth. “That’s a different question.”

“The man. The one who took it from me. He works for—”

“I know who he works for,” she cut in, her voice dropping even lower. “I know the department. I know the minister who signs their warrants. I know the system that pretends they don’t exist.” She leaned forward, just an inch. “What I need to know is why. Why you? Why this… ‘Caledonian’ project? And why give it to me?”

So he told her. Not everything, but the shape of it. The Gallowgate. The Clansman. Archie. The offer that wasn’t an offer. The slow, cold understanding of what they wanted him to be—a whisper in the dark, a poison in the ear. A native guide for a silent war. He told her about the moment he knew he couldn’t do it, the moment the patriot in him had choked on the betrayal. He called it “the job.” She would understand the euphemism.

She listened, her winter-sea eyes never leaving his face. She didn’t interrupt. When he finished, she sat back, absorbing it.

“They were recruiting you as an asset,” she stated. “To leverage community tensions. To provide deniable influence. A ‘Caledonian’ voice to say their British things.”

“Aye.”

“And you were their prototype. If you worked, there’d be others.”

“I suppose.”

She nodded slowly, as if a complex equation had finally balanced. “It fits a pattern. A pattern I’ve been trying to prove for eighteen months. Since I started asking questions about procurement contracts for surveillance tech, and about certain… extracurricular renditions. I became a problem. Then the rumours started. The smear campaign. The ‘mental exhaustion.’ The ‘unreliable’ tag.” She spoke without self-pity. It was a forensic report. “They’re very good at making problems go quiet. You chose not to go quiet. You chose to shout, in your way.”

“I chose to pass the parcel,” he said. “To someone who might know what to do with it.”

A faint, grim smile touched her lips. “The problem, Mr. McCallum, is that the parcel is radioactive. Anyone who holds it for too long gets sick. I am already sick. You have just given me the diagnosis.” She paused. “The man who intercepted you. He’s a cleaner. A facilitator. His call to me was a piece of theatre. A way to control the narrative. They know I have the documents. They know we are here. This meeting is likely being watched, recorded, and catalogued. We are on the stage, and they are writing the play.”

Donnie felt a cold that had nothing to do with the gallery’s air conditioning. He had not escaped the river. He had been treading water in a controlled tank. “So why come? Why agree?”

“Because you are a witness,” she said, her intensity burning through the weariness. “A credible, inconvenient witness from the world they want to manipulate. And because your defection, your ‘message in a bottle,’ is a crack in their armour. They can smear me. They can’t so easily explain you away. Not if you’re prepared to speak.”

“To who? The press? They’ll tie me in knots. Criminal record, history of… problems. I’m not credible.”

“Not to the press,” she said. “To a judge. In a closed tribunal. With a security-cleared barrister asking the questions. There are still people, in corners of the system, who remember what it’s supposed to be for. If I can get your testimony, alongside the documents, to the right corner…” She let it hang. “It’s a slim chance. But it’s the only one I have left. It’s the only one *we* have.”

The coffee arrived. Donnie ignored it. He was looking at the park through the glass, at the people walking their dogs, living their ordinary lives. He had swum for that shore. Now this woman, this ghost of a politician, was asking him to swim back out into the deepest, coldest part of the river.

“What happens if I say no?”

“Then I fight alone. I will probably lose. They will bury the documents, discredit me completely, and continue. They will find another Donnie McCallum. And he might not post the envelope.” She held his gaze. “You will go back to your sister’s house. You will fix more latches. And for a while, you might believe you are free. But you will know. You will always know that you had a chance to make the shout mean something, and you chose the quiet. The ordinary world is a beautiful place, Mr. McCallum. But it needs people willing to get dirty to protect it.”

He thought of Moira. *You don’t bring it back here.* He thought of the shed latch, smooth in its housing. He thought of the hollow inside him, which had never been emptiness at all. It had been a space waiting to be filled with a choice. The right fight. The right fighter.

“They’ll come for me,” he said.

“They already have,” she replied. “This *is* them coming for you. The polite, gallery-café version. Saying no just means the next version will be less polite.”

He picked up his coffee. It was lukewarm. He drank it anyway. “The closed tribunal. My testimony.”

“Yes.”

“When?”

“It could take weeks to arrange. Months. You’d need to disappear until then. Properly.”

“Disappear.” He gave a short, humourless laugh. “I just arrived.”

“I know people,” she said. “The right people. They can hide you. Keep you safe. It won’t be comfortable.”

He looked at her, this woman who had been broken by the same machine that had tried to buy him. She was offering him a path, not to victory, but to a kind of honourable defeat. A chance to be a virus that actually infected the bloodstream.

“Alright,” he said. The word was quiet, but it filled the hollow completely.

She didn’t thank him. She just gave a single, sharp nod. “Finish your coffee. Leave first. Go to the Manchester Museum, the one on Oxford Road. Wait in the entrance hall by the fossil of the mammoth. A woman will approach you. She will be wearing a green scarf and carrying a copy of *The Guardian*. She will say, ‘The tusk is longer than you’d think.’ You will go with her. Do not contact your sister. Do not go back to the house. They may be watching it by now.”

“Moira—”

“I will see that a message gets to her. A safe one. She’ll understand you had to go.”

He believed her. He finished the coffee, the bitterness fitting. He stood up. For a second, they looked at each other across the table—the failed politician and the broken soldier. A conspiracy of two in a gallery café.

“Good luck, Kat Fraser,” he said.

“See you on the other side, Donnie McCallum.”

He turned and walked out, through the bright galleries, past the abstract paintings and the silent sculptures. He didn’t look back. He stepped out into the dishwater-day. The ordinary world was all around him, the park, the students, the city hum. He was stepping out of it again. But this time, he was not running. He was walking towards the fossil of a mammoth, to meet a woman with a green scarf. He was choosing the river, not to drown in it, but to poison its source.

He crossed the grass, his shadow a faint smudge on the damp earth. Behind him, in the café, Kat Fraser remained at the table. She took a mobile phone from her pocket, a cheap, pay-as-you-go thing. She typed a single text message to a number not in its contacts.

*Asset acquired. Stage two is go.*

She deleted the message and the number. She sipped her cold tea. Her winter-sea eyes watched a figure in a dark coat, who had been reading a paper near the gallery shop, fold his paper and walk casually towards the exit. The river had eyes. And now, the river had a new current. She allowed herself one deep, shuddering breath. Then her face settled back into its mask of weary resolve. The play was underway. And she was no longer just an actress. She was, at last, a playwright.

# Chapter 11

## **CHAPTER 11**

The rain in the West End wasn’t a greasy smear. It was a fine, persistent mist, the kind that didn’t so much fall as hang in the air, beading on the leaves of the cherry trees in the Botanic Gardens. It softened the edges of the sandstone terraces, turned the paths to a muted ochre. Donnie McCallum walked through it every morning at half-eight, a paper cup of black coffee from the kiosk by the gate warming his hands. The routine was a new skin. It felt thin, but it held.

He had a room in a flat on Great Western Road, the top floor of a crumbling Victorian pile that smelled of old carpet and other people’s cooking. The landlady, a Polish woman with tired eyes and a sharp understanding of cash-in-hand, asked no questions. He paid a month in advance. The room had a narrow bed, a desk that listed to port, and a window that looked out over the back greens—a patchwork of washing lines and broken sheds. It was anonymous. It was perfect.

His days were a study in quiet. Mornings in the Gardens, walking the glasshouses, watching the pensioners with their dogs and the students cutting through to the university. The humid, earthy smell of the tropical house was a world away from the Gallowgate’s damp concrete. He’d sit on a bench near the pond, where the giant water lilies lay flat and complacent as green plates, and he would read. Not the news. He avoided that. He’d found a second-hand copy of *The Once and Future King* in a charity shop. The myth of a man made for a purpose, then broken by it, then pieced back together for something quieter. He saw the irony. He drank his coffee and let the words wash over him.

Afternoons, he walked. He learned the geography of this different Glasgow. The wide, tree-lined boulevards of the West End, the bustle of Byres Road with its bookshops and bars full of young voices discussing things that felt, to him, like artefacts from a lost civilisation. He kept his head down, his collar up. He was a ghost in a duffel coat. He ate in cheap cafés where the food was stodgy and the other customers were alone with their thoughts. He integrated the lessons of his adventure not through grand action, but through a deliberate, practised stillness. He was learning to be still. To watch the river from the bank, not to be in its current. Kat Fraser’s voice was a constant echo: *You are choosing the river. To poison its source.* The source felt very far away. The waiting was the work.

***

The call came on a Thursday. The rain had given way to a brittle, high-skied afternoon, the sun a cold coin in a pale blue vault. The mobile phone, a cheap burner he’d bought with the last of the cash Kat had given him, vibrated on the desk with a sound like an angry wasp.

“Aye?”

“It’s me.” Moira’s voice was tinny, strained down the line. “You’re alright?”

“I’m standing.” He looked out the window at a magpie pecking at something in the grass. One for sorrow. “You?”

“Aye. Keeping the heid.” A pause, filled with the static of distance and things unsaid. “I’ve got something for you. From her. Can you meet?”

He felt the old instinct tighten his shoulders. The glance towards the door, the calculation of exits. He let the breath out slowly. “Where?”

“The Hidden Lane. In Finnieston. The tea room. Half-four.”

She hung up. The Hidden Lane. It was a place of twee workshops and artist studios, a world of watercolour paintings and hand-thrown pottery. It was not a place for him. Which, he supposed, was the point.

He got there early. The lane was a narrow cobbled passage tucked behind the main road, a secret the city had mostly forgotten. The tea room was all mismatched china and the smell of baking shortbread. He took a table in the corner, his back to the wall. He ordered a pot of tea he didn’t want and watched the door.

Moira came in five minutes late, bringing a gust of cold air with her. She looked older. It wasn’t the lines on her face, which were the same, but the set of her. The light in her eyes had been banked, like a fire put under ashes for the night. She saw him, gave a tight nod, and came over, shedding a sensible beige coat.

“You look like a student,” she said, sitting, her eyes doing a quick, professional sweep of the room.

“It’s the duffel coat. Camouflage.”

A wan smile touched her lips. The waitress brought her a pot of tea and a slice of carrot cake. They waited in silence until she was gone.

“How is she?” Donnie asked, the question out before he could stop it.

Moira’s eyes met his. There was a warning there, and a pity. “She’s in the game. Don’t ask after her. It’s the rule.”

He nodded. The bitter taste of the gallery café coffee was back in his mouth. “What have you got?”

She opened her handbag, a large, practical leather affair. She didn’t take anything out. Just left it gaping on her lap. “A message. Two words. ‘Dig deep.’ That’s it.”

*Dig deep.* He turned the words over. They were not an instruction. They were a reminder. A soldier’s reminder. For the long wait, for the cold nights, for the moments when the purpose fogs over and all you have is the dirt under your nails.

“And this,” Moira said softly. From the bag, she slid a small, rectangular object wrapped in a Tesco carrier bag and placed it on the table between the sugar bowl and the milk jug. “She said you’d know what to do with it.”

Donnie didn’t touch it. He knew the weight, the size. Through the thin plastic, he could see the shape of a small, hardback notebook. His father’s notebook. The one from the lockbox in the house. The house he couldn’t go back to.

His throat tightened. “How?”

“A cleaner with a key and a fifty-pound note.” Moira sipped her tea. Her hand was steady. “It was all that was taken. If they were watching, they’ll think it was a random junkie. Not a man who’d want his da’s old work notes.”

He left the package on the table. A fossil from a previous life. “And my sister?”

“She’s worried. But she’s tough. Like her brother.” Moira’s gaze was direct now. “I told her you had to go away for work. Security contract. Somewhere with a bad phone signal. She’s not happy, but she believes it. You’ll call her when you can. Not from that thing.” She nodded at the burner in his pocket.

“Thank you, Moira.”

“Don’t thank me. I’m not doing this for you. I’m doing it for her. And for a version of this city that doesn’t deserve to be flushed down a sewer by the men in the shiny suits.” She said it without heat, a simple statement of fact. She took a bite of her cake, chewed, swallowed. The mundane act was more intimate than anything they’d said. “You’ve settled?”

“I’m a ghost. It suits me.”

“Aye. For now.” She finished her tea, checked her watch. A woman with a life to get back to. A life of constituency meetings and supermarket openings and pretending the world was sane. “The waiting’s the hard part. It gets into your bones. Makes you doubt why you’re there at all.”

“You sound like you know.”

She gave him a look then, a crack in the beige, sensible armour. A flash of the young woman who’d once stood on picket lines, who’d believed in the fire of change. “Everyone who’s ever tried to push a rock uphill knows, Donnie. You just have to remember the view from the top is worth it. Even if you never get there.”

She stood, put on her coat, left a ten-pound note under her saucer. “Dig deep,” she said again, quietly, and then she was gone, a sensible figure disappearing into the gloom of the lane.

He sat for another twenty minutes, finishing his cold tea. He finally picked up the plastic-wrapped notebook and put it in his pocket. It felt like carrying a live coal. A piece of his past, handed to him in the present, for a future he couldn’t see. A hint, a thread, left dangling by a woman with winter-sea eyes. The mystery wasn’t over. It was hibernating.

***

That night, in the quiet of his rented room, with the yellow glow of the streetlamp painting a faint trapezoid on the ceiling, he unwrapped the notebook. It was exactly as he remembered: the scuffed black cover, the faded gold lettering on the spine that said *Ledger*. His father’s meticulous, small handwriting filled it, page after page. Dates, times, vehicle registrations, names. Observations from a lifetime of driving a cab for the council, ferrying officials from here to there, his ears always open, his eyes always noting. It was a chronicle of small, bureaucratic corruptions. A tenner slipped for a parking pass that shouldn’t be issued. A name moved up a housing list. A contract steered towards a brother-in-law’s firm.

Donnie had read it years ago, after the funeral, with a sick feeling in his gut. He’d seen it as a testament to his father’s quiet cynicism, his proof that the whole game was rigged. Now, with the mist of the Botanic Gardens still damp in his hair and Kat Fraser’s words in his ears, he read it differently.

He wasn’t looking for the corruption. He was looking for the pattern. The river had a source. This was a map of its tributaries. The names were small fry, but they were connected. A web of favours and debts. And in the back, on the last few pages, the entries changed. The handwriting grew tighter, more hurried. The names became less frequent, replaced by initials and question marks. And there, on the very last page, a single line, underlined twice:

*K.F. – The new dredger. Who pays the ferryman?*

K.F. Kat Fraser. The new dredger. And a question his father had never answered.

Donnie closed the book. The room felt smaller, the air thinner. The past wasn’t just speaking to him; it was pointing a finger. His father, the quiet, defeated man who’d come home smelling of stale smoke and disappointment, had been watching the river too. He’d seen the new current coming. And he’d written it down.

This was the dangling thread. Not a mystery from his adventure, but one that had been woven into his life long before he’d met Kat Fraser. The hook was in his own flesh. He put the notebook under his mattress, a flat, hard secret. The play was underway, and he was not just an actor following a script. He held a page from an earlier draft.

***

A week later, the first frost came. It silvered the grass in the back greens, made the cobbles of the Hidden Lane slick and treacherous. Donnie’s routine held. The Gardens in the morning, the walks in the afternoon. He felt a change within it, a solidity. The lessons were no longer something he was integrating; they were the mortar between the bricks of his days. Patience. Observation. The understanding that some fights are not won with a charge, but with a slow, relentless pressure.

He stood on the Kelvin Walkway, watching the brown, peat-heavy water of the river churn under the bridge. The summer floods were a memory; the river was back within its banks, powerful but contained. He thought of his father’s question. *Who pays the ferryman?* In the old stories, the dead paid with a coin under their tongue. In this story, the living paid with their silence, their compliance, their small, everyday compromises.

He wouldn’t pay. Not anymore. He had chosen the river. To poison its source. The source was not a person, or a place. It was the silence. It was the belief that the greasy rain was just weather, and not a symptom. His father had documented the symptom. Kat was attacking the disease. And he was the instrument. A scalpel, waiting in sterilised stillness.

He turned his back on the water and walked up towards the university. The Gothic spires were stark against the winter-blue sky. Students streamed past him, laughing, arguing, alive with a future he couldn’t touch. He didn’t envy them. His own future was a narrow, focused thing. A path leading towards a door he couldn’t yet see. But for the first time since he’d come back from the desert, since he’d drifted through the Gallowgate rain, he felt no dread at its narrowing. A path was something you could walk. A direction was a kind of peace.

He was at peace with his past. The ghost of his father was no longer a weight on his back, but a companion in the shadows, holding a dim light. The ghost of the soldier he had been was laid to rest in the quiet discipline of waiting. He was Donnie McCallum, a man in a duffel coat, walking a city that knew him not. He was ready for what was next.

He bought a *Herald* from a stand. He folded it under his arm. He would go back to his room, make tea on the single ring, and he would read. Later, he might walk down to the river again, in the dark, to see the city lights reflected in the black water. He was choosing the river. And the river, in its own slow time, was coming to meet him.

Across the street, in the window of a charity shop, a television was playing the evening news. A bland-faced presenter spoke of cross-party initiatives and investment opportunities. A politician he didn’t recognise was shaking hands with a man in an expensive overcoat. The man turned slightly, laughing at something, and the streetlight caught the heavy silver signet ring on his hand. The image lasted a second before the camera cut away.

Donnie stopped walking. His blood, for a single, frozen heartbeat, seemed to pause in his veins. He knew that ring. He had seen it on a different hand, in a different life, under a desert sun. It had been on the finger of a man who gave orders in quiet, reasonable tones, orders that ended in sand and fire and long, screaming silences.

The television moved on to a sports report. The window reflected the ordinary street, the passing buses, his own still face.

The hook was not just in his flesh. It was in the world, turning casually in the light, waiting for him to see it. The play was underway. And the playwright had just introduced a character from the second act.

Donnie McCallum took a deep, shuddering breath of the cold Glasgow air. Then he turned and walked on, his step steady, his shadow long and definite on the frost-whitened pavement. He was ready.

# Chapter 12

## **FINAL CHAPTER**

The rain on the Gallowgate wasn’t water, it was a greasy smear. It fell in a slant, needling the hunched shoulders of the tenements, turning the granite from proud grey to a weeping black. But this time, Donnie McCallum was walking in it.

He turned the collar of his duffel coat up against the weather, the wool damp and familiar against his neck. The *Clansman* was up ahead, its windows a warm, bleary glow in the late afternoon gloom. He didn’t go in. He paused on the opposite side of the street, where the young lad had been, and watched the condensation run in slow, dirty tears down the glass. A figure was silhouetted there now, a man alone with a pint, staring out at the world as if through a scrim. Donnie saw his own ghost in that window, the man he’d been for twenty years—a man waiting for the rain to stop, for the past to dissolve, for a sign.

He had his sign now. It was a heavy silver ring on a soft, powerful hand. It was a name, pulled from the depths of a memory he’d tried to drown in whisky and silence: Alistair Thorne. Not a soldier, but a procurer. A man who built bridges between deserts and boardrooms. The hook was set, and Donnie had spent the last six weeks pulling on the line, not to free himself, but to see what monstrous shape was on the other end.

He turned from the pub window and walked on. The rain needled him, but it did not pierce. He was not hunched. His shoulders were square under the weight of what he carried, a weight he had chosen.

**Scene 1: The Ripples**

The community centre on Saracen Street was humming. It was a different kind of noise than the old, tense silence of the betting shop that had once occupied the unit. This was the clatter of a commercial dishwasher from the new social enterprise café, the scrape of chairs in a meeting room where a tenants’ union was planning its response to a regeneration proposal, the laughter of kids in a free after-school club run by volunteers.

Moira was behind the café counter, her arms dusted with flour. She was showing a nervous young woman, new to the scheme, how to laminate pastry for the next day’s bridies. “It’s no’ about bein’ perfect, hen,” Moira said, her voice softer than Donnie had ever heard it. “It’s about bein’ consistent. The folds hold the heat, see?”

Donnie stood in the doorway, unseen. He saw Rab at a corner table, a ledger open before him, deep in conversation with a man in a cleric’s collar and a woman with the sharp eyes of a funding officer. Rab’s hands moved as he talked, sketching possibilities in the air. The frantic, paranoid energy that had once animated him was now channelled, focused into this. He was building something. He caught Donnie’s eye and gave a small, grave nod. Not a smile, but an acknowledgement. A comrade’s salute.

This was the wider impact. It wasn’t in headlines. The news had moved on from the brief, puzzling item about the sudden resignation of a well-connected private security consultant from the board of a lucrative infrastructure fund. There had been no charges, no scandal—just a quiet, professional disappearance. The ripples of that disappearance, however, were here. In the secure funding for this centre, anonymously guaranteed. In the withdrawn planning objections for the community land trust. In the space that had been opened, a space not carved out by violence or threat, but by the precise, surgical application of truth. Donnie had not brought a war to Thorne’s doorstep. He had delivered a file. A file of photographs, dates, and bank routing numbers. A quiet conversation between the man with the ring and people whose power made his look like a child’s toy. The play had been underway, and Donnie had simply rewritten the final act, off-stage.

He slipped out before Moira or Rab could come over. Their gratitude was a palpable thing, but it was a weight he didn’t need to carry. He had done it for the debt, yes—for the young lad in the tracksuit, for Rab’s brother, for all the ghosts in the sand. But also for the living. For the kid who wouldn’t have a bookie as his nursery. This was his society now. Not the regiment, not the shadow world of contractors. This rainy, resilient, granite city. He had altered its fabric, just a thread, and in doing so, it had begun to alter his.

**Scene 2: The Ally**

The river was high, a swollen, muscular grey under the iron sky. Donnie walked along the path towards the university, the Victorian Gothic towers looming like a promise of a different kind of order. He found her on their usual bench, looking not at the water, but at a thick sheaf of paper in her hands.

Dr. Anya Petrova didn’t startle when he sat down. She simply turned the last page, placed it carefully on top of the stack, and let out a long, slow breath that fogged in the air. “It is accepted,” she said, her voice thick with a emotion she rarely showed. “The paper. The review is complete. They will publish.”

Donnie looked at the title page: *“Narrative as Neuroplastic Intervention: A Case Series from Post-Conflict Glasgow.”* Her work. Their work, in a way. The long, patient hours in her clinical room, her quiet questions, his halting answers. She had used his story, anonymised, distilled into data points and therapeutic frameworks. She had turned his pain into a tool that might, in some small way, help others.

“I told you it was good,” he said.

She laughed, a short, surprised sound. “You said it was ‘better than a punch in the face.’ High praise from you.” She looked at him, her sharp eyes missing nothing. “You look… settled. The thing you were waiting for. It is done?”

“It’s done.”
“And the man? The one from the television?”
“Gone. To a villa in a country with no extradition. A quieter life.”
“You let him go.”
“I showed him the door,” Donnie corrected softly. “Some men, when they see the door, understand the cell is already gone. He was a practical man.”

Anya nodded, accepting the distinction. She placed a hand on the manuscript. “This is because of you. Not just the data. The… the permission. To hope for a result.”

“It’s because of you,” he said. “You stayed. You asked the questions. You built the boat.” He gestured to the river. “I just got in.”

She smiled, a proper one that reached her eyes. “A very shaky passenger. But you learned to row.” She stood, tucking the precious pages into her bag. “I have a bottle of terrible Polish vodka in my office. For medicinal publication purposes. Will you…?”

He shook his head. “Another time. I’ve got somewhere to be.”

She didn’t press. She just squeezed his shoulder once, a firm, professional touch that was, between them, an embrace. “Then go. The river will still be here tomorrow.”

He watched her walk back towards the university, a small, determined figure against the vast stone. Her life was altered, set on a new, affirmed course. She had her evidence, her vindication. He had given her that. And she, in return, had given him the words for what he had become. Not healed. Not fixed. But *integrated*. The past was no longer a foreign country; it was a contested district in the city of himself, and he had learned the maps.

**Scene 3: The Quiet Reflection**

His room was as sparse as ever. The single bed, the chair, the small table with the single-ring hob. But it was different. A stack of books from the library sat on the windowsill—history, local botany, a dog-eared book of poetry by Norman MacCaig. The *Herald* was folded on the table, open at the jobs section, not the obituaries. A single circle was drawn in faint pencil around an ad for a groundsman at the Necropolis. *“Quiet, conscientious individual. Knowledge of stonework an advantage.”*

He filled the kettle and set it to boil. The ritual was the same, but the man performing it was not. He was content. Not happy—that was a fleeting, skittish thing, like a sunbeam on the wet pavement. Contentment was deeper, a bedrock. It was the absence of the old, screaming restlessness. The ghost of his father was quiet, not as a companion, but as a memory finally laid in its own grave. The ghost of the soldier was a tool in a shed, to be used with respect and put away. He was Donnie McCallum. A man who had paid his debts. A man who could sit in a silent room and hear only the kettle coming to the boil, and the distant, steady sigh of the city.

He poured the water over the tea bag in his mug. He did not look out the window. He looked at the circle on the newspaper. It was a future. Small, tangible, rooted in stone and green, growing things. A purpose that would outlast him, quietly. He would walk among the monuments, tending to the lichen and the weathered angels, a keeper of silence for the dead. It was enough.

He sipped his tea. It was hot, bitter, perfect.

**Scene 4: The Mirror, Filled**

The rain had softened to a drizzle, a fine mist that haloed the streetlights. Donnie walked, not with direction, but with a quiet allegiance. His feet took him back, as he knew they would. To the Gallowgate. To the *Clansman*.

He pushed the door open. The warmth and the peat-smoke smell and the low murmur of conversation wrapped around him like a worn blanket. A few regulars glanced up, nodded. He was no longer a spectre at the window; he was a man who came in sometimes, who drank a pint slowly, who was no trouble.

He didn’t take the table by the window. He stood at the bar. Tam, the barman, raised a bushy eyebrow.
“Pint of heavy, Donnie?”
“Aye.”
As Tam pulled the pint, Donnie’s eyes went to the steamed-up window. The condensation still ran in slow, dirty tears. But through a cleared swipe of glass, he could see out.

Outside, a young lad in a tracksuit top—still too big—was walking past. He wasn’t hunched against the rain. He was walking with a loose, easy stride, head up, one hand in his pocket, the other holding a phone to his ear. He was laughing at something, his breath a puff of vapour in the lamplight. He didn’t see Donnie. He was just a boy, living his life on the Gallowgate, under the same greasy smear of rain. But he was not trying to shield anything. He was just moving through it.

Tam set the pint down, the creamy head perfect. Donnie paid, lifted it, and took a long, slow drink. It tasted of the earth and the sky and the long, patient work of fermentation. It tasted of now.

He turned and leaned his back against the bar, surveying the room. The old men playing dominoes. The couple talking in low tones over a half-finished meal. The fire muttering in the grate. It was all the same. And it was all utterly, profoundly different.

He was not watching from the outside. He was standing within the warmth. The hook was gone. The line was cut. The playwright had left the theatre, and the stage belonged to the characters again, to live their ordinary, extraordinary lives.

Donnie finished his pint. He set the empty glass on the bar with a soft, final click. He nodded to Tam. Then he walked to the door, pulled it open, and stepped out into the Glasgow night.

The rain met him, the same greasy smear. It fell in a slant, needling the shoulders of the tenements, turning the granite from proud grey to a weeping black. Donnie McCallum turned his face up to it. He felt it, cold and insistent on his skin. It was just rain. And he was just a man, walking home in it.

He pulled his duffel coat tight and began to walk, his footsteps steady on the wet pavement, his shadow stretching long and definite behind him under the streetlights, merging with the thousand other shadows of the city, part of the dark, living tapestry at last.

# Chapter 13

## **CHAPTER 13**

The rain had stopped, but the Gallowgate still gleamed under the streetlights, a black mirror fractured by the orange glow of sodium vapour. Donnie’s footsteps, steady and sure, were the only sound in the close-mouth where he finally stopped. The tenement door was a heavy, scarred thing of dark wood and flaking paint. His key turned in the lock with a clunk that echoed up the stone stairwell, a sound as familiar as his own breath. The close smelled of damp stone, of bleach from a recent mopping, and underneath it all, the faint, permanent scent of old coal dust and living. He climbed the stairs, his hand skimming the smooth dip in the centre of the banister, worn by generations of palms.

His flat was on the third floor. The door was identical to all the others. He let himself in.

The air inside was still and slightly cold. He flicked the light on, the single bulb in the ceiling shade casting a weak, jaundiced light over the single-end. It was all as he’d left it that morning: the narrow bed against the far wall, neatly made; the small gas fire, dead in its grate; the sink in the corner with one cup and one plate drying on the draining board; the table under the window with its single chair. A monk’s cell. A watchman’s post. For years, it had been both. He hung his duffel coat on the hook behind the door and stood for a moment, listening to the silence. It was no longer the silence of a man holding his breath. It was just silence. He could hear a telly playing two floors down, the muffared bass of a passing car, the distant, rhythmic thump of a washing machine in the building next door. The sounds of the tenement, breathing around him.

He filled the kettle at the sink, the pipes groaning in the walls. As he waited for it to boil, he stood at the window, looking down into the back court. A rectangle of darkness, punctuated by the faint yellow squares of other windows. A line of washing hung, motionless and heavy with wet, between two rusted poles. A cat picked its way fastidiously along the top of a wall. It was a view he’d looked at for a decade, a stage set he’d observed but never entered. The hook was gone. The line was cut. The thought returned, not as a revelation, but as a simple, solid fact, like the table under his hands.

He made tea in the pot, the one decent thing he owned, a brown glazed thing that had been his mother’s. He poured a cup, added a splash of milk, and sat at the table. The tea was hot and sharp. He drank it looking at the blank wall opposite, not with vacancy, but with a kind of patient assessment. The room felt different. It was no longer a capsule suspended in time. It was a place in a building, in a street, in a city. It had a future. He would need to buy another chair.

The knock at the door, when it came, was soft. Three precise taps. Not Archie’s heavy fist. Donnie set his cup down. He crossed the room and opened the door.

Father Malachy stood on the landing. The priest was a slight man, swallowed by a black overcoat that was too big for him, the collar of his roman visible at the neck. His face was pale, etched with fine lines that spoke of late nights and quiet worries rather than laughter. He held a flat, rectangular parcel wrapped in brown paper under one arm.

“Donnie,” he said. His voice was quiet, suited to the close. “I saw your light. I hope it’s not an intrusion.”

Donnie stepped back. “No. Come in.”

The priest entered, his eyes taking in the room with a gentle, unjudging sweep. He’d been here before, once, years ago, after Donnie’s mother. He nodded towards the table. “May I?”

“Aye. Tea’s fresh.”

“That would be grand.”

Donnie fetched the other cup from the drainer, poured, and set it before the priest. Father Malachy shrugged out of his coat, draping it over the back of the chair, and sat. He placed the brown paper parcel on the table between them. They drank in silence for a moment, the only sound the soft slur of tea and the distant hum of the city.

“I heard about Moira,” Donnie said finally.

Father Malachy nodded, his hands cradling the cup for warmth. “Aye. Thursday. Peaceful, in the end. She was ready. More ready than any of us who loved her were to let her go.” He took a sip. “She asked for you. In the last week. Several times.”

Donnie felt the words settle in the room. They didn’t land with a weight of guilt, but with a soft, sad pressure, like a hand on his shoulder. “I should have gone.”

“She understood. She said you were on a journey of your own. That some paths have to be walked alone before you can come back to the crossroads.” The priest’s smile was thin, weary. “She had a way of putting things.”

“She did.”

Another silence, comfortable in its shared memory of the woman. Father Malachy nudged the parcel with a finger. “She left instructions. For after. This is for you.”

Donnie looked at the parcel. It was about the size of a large book, neatly wrapped, tied with string. “What is it?”

“I don’t know. She gave it to me a month ago. Said to bring it to you after the funeral. Not before.” He pushed it across the table. “She was very specific.”

Donnie untied the string, the rough fibre catching on his skin. He folded back the brown paper. Inside was a photograph album, the old-fashioned kind with black cardboard pages and thick, crêpe paper corners. The cover was a faded, mottled green. He opened it.

The first photograph was black and white, curled at the edges. A group of men and women, dressed in their best, standing outside a church. He recognised his mother, young, her hair in a style he’d only seen in other photos, a shy smile on her face. Next to her, a tall, broad-shouldered man with a strong jaw and Donnie’s own eyes. His father. He’d seen few pictures of him. Here he was, an arm around his wife, looking not at the camera but down at her, an expression of unguarded affection on his face that made Donnie’s throat tighten. He turned the page. More photos. His parents at a seaside, his father in rolled-up trousers, his mother laughing. A wedding. Christenings of babies he didn’t recognise. Then, a photo of his father alone, standing by a crane on the Clyde, squinting into the sun, a cigarette dangling from his lips. A working man, proud in his element.

He turned another page. Colour photos now, faded to blues and oranges. Himself as a boy, gap-toothed, holding a fishing rod on a canal bank. His mother, older, in the kitchen of the old house. And then, a photo he had never seen. It was of Moira and his mother, sitting on the stoop of this very tenement, cups in their hands, caught in mid-laughter. They looked like sisters. The date was scrawled in white ink in the corner: *June ‘78*.

He went through the album page by page. It was not his family’s history, not exactly. It was the history of his mother’s life, her friendships, her joys. And Moira was woven through it like a golden thread, from young woman to old lady. The final photo was recent, taken maybe five years ago. Moira and his mother, arms linked, standing in the Botanic Gardens under a canopy of green. Both grey-haired, both smiling the same wrinkled, defiant smile. His mother was looking at the camera. Moira was looking at his mother.

Donnie closed the album. The room felt very small, very full.

“She wanted you to have that,” Father Malachy said softly. “She said you had the right to see the whole tapestry, not just the thread you were part of. She said… she said a man can’t know where he’s going if he doesn’t understand the cloth he’s cut from.”

Donnie placed his hand on the green cover. The cardboard was warm from the room. “Thank you for bringing it.”

“It was my honour.” The priest finished his tea. “There’s something else. She left a letter. With me. To be given to you with the album.” He reached into the inside pocket of his jacket and produced a plain white envelope, sealed. Donnie’s name was written on the front in Moira’s looping, elegant script.

He took it. The paper was thick, expensive. He broke the seal and took out a single sheet.

*Donnie,*

*If you’re reading this, I’m gone, and you’ve spoken to Malachy. He’s a good man. Trust him.*

*The album is for you. Your mother was my dearest friend. Her joy was a quiet, stubborn thing, like a flower growing through a crack in the pavement. She found it in small moments. In a good cup of tea. In the light on the river. In you. She loved your father fiercely, and his loss was a fracture in her world she never truly let heal. But she never let it poison her joy, either. She taught me that. I pass the lesson to you.*

*Now, the difficult bit. I have a favour to ask. A final one. It involves the past, and it’s not a simple thing. There is a box, in a safe deposit box at the Clydeside Bank on Argyle Street. The key is taped to the back of the photograph of your father by the crane. The box is in my name, but the contents… they belong to your family. To your father.*

*I have kept it for thirty-five years. It was given to me for safekeeping, with instructions to pass it on when the time was right. I never knew if the right time would come. I think, perhaps, it has. Now that you are walking within the warmth, and not watching from the window.*

*Take Malachy with you. He knows the manager. He will vouch for you. See what is in the box. Then decide what to do. There is no debt here, Donnie. Only a choice. You can walk away from it, and I would understand completely. But I think you should look. A man should know the weight of his inheritance, even if he chooses to leave it on the shelf.*

*Be at peace, Donnie McCallum. You were a good son to your mother. You are a good man. Remember to laugh. It confuses the darkness.*

*With all my affection,*
*Moira*

Donnie read the letter twice. The words were so clearly her voice he could almost hear it in the quiet room. He looked up at Father Malachy. The priest’s expression was calm, waiting.

“You know what this is about?” Donnie asked.

“I know there is a box. I know Moira wanted you to see it. I do not know what is in it.” He leaned forward slightly. “She was a woman of profound integrity, Donnie. If she kept something for thirty-five years, she had a powerful reason.”

Donnie turned the letter over. Nothing on the back. He looked at the album, then back at the priest. The hook was gone. The line was cut. But the past was not a play that had ended. It was a room in a house you still lived in, and sometimes you opened a door you thought was a cupboard and found a staircase leading down.

“The bank,” Donnie said. “It’ll be open tomorrow.”

“I’ve already spoken to the manager. We can go at ten.”

Donnie nodded. He felt a strange calm. This was not a summons from the shadows. It was a request from a friend. A choice. “Aye. Ten o’clock.”

Father Malachy stood, collecting his coat. He paused at the door. “She loved you, you know. Like you were her own. This… whatever it is… it comes from that love. Not from a desire to burden.”

“I know.”

After the priest had gone, his footsteps fading down the stair, Donnie returned to the table. He lifted the album and found the photograph of his father by the crane. Carefully, he peeled back the black cardboard page. Taped to the back, yellowed with age, was a small, tarnished silver key. He pried it free. It was cold in his palm. He set it on the table beside Moira’s letter.

He made another pot of tea and sat through the long Glasgow night, turning the pages of the album again and again. He studied the face of the father he could barely remember, looking for clues in the set of his shoulders, the tilt of his head. He looked at his mother’s laughing face, trying to see the woman behind the mother he had known, the woman who had been Moira’s friend, who had loved a shipyard worker and found joy in cracks in the pavement. The flat was no longer a cell. It was becoming an archive. A connecting point between then and now.

He did not sleep. When the first grey light began to seep around the edges of the window blind, he washed his face in the cold water from the sink. He dressed in his one good shirt and the same duffel coat. He put the key and Moira’s letter in his inside pocket. He left the album open on the table, to the photo of the two old women in the Botanic Gardens.

He met Father Malachy outside the bank at five minutes to ten. The sky was a low, uniform grey, the colour of a pigeon’s wing. The Clyde, visible at the end of the street, was a slick, leaden sheet. The bank was a Victorian edifice of sandstone, all pillars and gravitas, standing between a betting shop and a discount shoe warehouse.

The manager, a man called Mr. Greig with a handshake like a damp fish and eyes that missed nothing, was expecting them. He led them through a hushed, carpeted area of tellers’ counters, through a heavy oak door, and down a flight of stairs into a vault. The air was cool and smelled of old metal and dust. Walls of safe deposit boxes, small brass doors numbered and blank, stretched into the gloom.

“Box 417,” Mr. Greig said, his voice echoing slightly. He used a master key on one lock, then nodded to Donnie. “Your key, sir.”

Donnie took the small silver key from his pocket. It felt insignificant. It slid into the second lock with a smooth, well-oiled click. He turned it. The door swung open.

Inside was a metal box, about twelve inches long, six wide, three deep. Donnie lifted it out. It was heavier than it looked.

“There is a private room,” Mr. Greig said, gesturing to a small, windowless alcove with a table and two chairs. “Take all the time you need.”

Donnie and Father Malachy went in. The priest closed the door. The room was soundless, lit by a single fluorescent tube that buzzed faintly. Donnie placed the box on the table. He looked at the priest, who gave a slight, encouraging nod.

He lifted the lid.

On top, folded neatly, was a man’s woollen jumper, navy blue, cable-knit. Underneath it, a bundle of letters tied with a faded ribbon. A small, velvet jewellery box. And beneath it all, a thick, hardbacked ledger, bound in black leather.

Donnie lifted the jumper. It smelled faintly of mothballs and, underneath, a ghost of tobacco and engine oil. His father’s smell, or his memory of it. He set it aside. The letters were all addressed to his mother, in his father’s rough, blocky handwriting. He didn’t open them. The jewellery box contained a single item: a woman’s fob watch, silver, on a delicate chain. The glass was cracked. He didn’t recognise it.

Finally, he lifted the ledger. It was weighty, substantial. He opened it.

The pages were filled with columns of numbers, dates, and initials, written in a precise, copperplate hand that was not his father’s. It was a record of transactions. Payments in, payments out. The sums were not large, but they were consistent. And beside many of the entries, in the margin, was a tiny, inked symbol: a simplified drawing of a crane.

Donnie turned the pages. The entries spanned years, from the late sixties to the early eighties. The last entry was dated two weeks before his father’s death. He flicked back, his eyes scanning. He saw initials he didn’t recognise. Then, near the front, he saw a name, written in full: *A. McCallum*. His father. An entry for a payment in. Then, a few pages later, an entry for a payment out, to the same initials. A loan. Repaid.

He kept looking. Other names appeared, some crossed out with a single, firm line. One name, *L. O’Donnell*, was circled. On the page opposite that entry, in a different, hastier ink, was written: *Clyde Navigation Trust, Lot 14, Surveyor’s Report – Missing*.

Father Malachy was watching him, his face pale in the harsh light. “Donnie?”

Donnie closed the ledger. The sound was a soft, definitive *thump* in the quiet room. He looked at the collection on the table. The jumper. The love letters. The broken watch. The book of numbers.

This was not a treasure. It was an archive of a different kind. A record of quiet deals, of favours and debts among working men. A ledger from a time when the yards were closing and men did what they had to do to keep their families afloat. And his father’s name was in it. His father, who had died in an accident on a half-built oil platform in a storm. An accident that had never been fully explained.

Moira’s words echoed. *A man should know the weight of his inheritance, even if he chooses to leave it on the shelf.*

He knew now. The weight was not gold. It was responsibility. It was knowledge. It was a ledger that connected his honest, laughing father in the photograph to a shadow-world of whispered agreements, and to a name circled in a book, and to a missing surveyor’s report for a river lot.

He placed everything back into the metal box, except the ledger. He closed the lid. He looked at Father Malachy.

“I need to know who L. O’Donnell is,” Donnie said, his voice quiet but clear in the sealed room. “And I need to know what happened to that surveyor’s report.”

The priest held his gaze for a long moment. He saw the resolve there, not the hot burn of vengeance, but the cold, steady determination of a man stepping into a current he had avoided for a lifetime. He saw Donnie McCallum not walking away from the past, but turning to face it, square on.

“Then we’d better start asking,” Father Malachy said. “Quietly.”

Donnie tucked the black ledger under his arm. It felt like carrying a piece of the city’s bedrock, dark and dense with old secrets. He switched off the buzzing light, and they stepped out of the private room, back into the vault, where a thousand other brass doors kept their own silent counsel, waiting for the right key, the right heir, the right time to speak.

# Chapter 14

## **CHAPTER 14**

The air in the vault was a constant, clammy fifty-five degrees, a temperature for preserving paper and slowing decay. It felt colder now, with the ledger under Donnie’s arm. It leached the warmth from his side through his jacket, a slow, insistent chill. The brass doors lining the narrow passage watched them go, each a silent, riveted eye.

Father Malachy led the way, his footsteps a soft, measured scuff on the stone flags. He didn’t speak until they were back in the wood-panelled office, the door to the vault closed with a solid, muffled *thud* that seemed to seal the past back in its tomb. The ordinary world of a desk, a telephone, a calendar from a local funeral home, felt thin and unconvincing.

“L. O’Donnell,” the priest said, settling behind his desk. He didn’t reach for a phone or a directory. He laced his fingers together on the blotter. “You’ll not find that in a census. Not the one you’re looking for.”

Donnie remained standing. He placed the ledger on the desk. It made no sound on the leather. “You know it.”

“I know *of* it. A name that wasn’t a name. A company that wasn’t a company. More of a… a understanding. In the late seventies, early eighties, when the bottom fell out of the yards and the cranes stood still like skeletons, a man needed work. A man with a family, a mortgage.” Malachy’s eyes were on the ledger, but he was seeing something else. “L. O’Donnell was a whisper. It was the answer to a quiet question asked in a snug bar, or after a union meeting that had yielded nothing but despair. It was off-the-books labour for off-the-books projects. Cash in hand, no questions asked, and you asked none in return.”

“My father asked questions,” Donnie said. His voice was flat. “He’s in your book. He took the work.”

“Aye, he’s in the book. Many good men are. It wasn’t a mark of shame, son. It was a mark of necessity. L. O’Donnell provided a lifeline when the official ones had been cut. But it was a lifeline with a hook in it. The work was hard, often dangerous. Sites that weren’t quite legal. Demolitions without all the permits. Foundations poured after dark.” Malachy leaned forward. “And if a man was sharp, if he saw something that wasn’t right—a measurement fudged, a safety standard ignored, a material that wasn’t what it was supposed to be—he had a choice. He could voice it, and lose the lifeline. Or he could stay quiet, take the cash, and swallow the unease.”

Donnie saw it. His father, coming home later, the smell of strange concrete and diesel on his clothes instead of shipyard rust. The extra notes in the tin on the mantelpiece. The forced cheer. The unease that his mother had mistaken for tiredness. “The accident on the platform. The one that killed him. Was it an O’Donnell job?”

Malachy’s silence was its own answer. It stretched, filled only by the distant hum of the city through the thick walls. “I don’t have that knowledge,” he said finally, which was not the same as a no. “What I know is that by ’83, ’84, the whisper of L. O’Donnell changed. The work got bigger. The projects moved from patching up warehouses to parcels of land, riverfront lots. The money was better, but the men… the men who asked the quieter questions started to drift away. Or they had accidents.”

“And the surveyor’s report? For the river lot in the ledger.”

“That,” Malachy sighed, “is where the whisper becomes a shout. A missing document like that, for a piece of land that was about to be bought for a song… that’s not an oversight. That’s a surgery. Someone cut out the cancer before it could spread.”

“Who benefited?”

“Who always benefits? The man who ends up with the land.” Malachy pushed back from his desk. “But that’s a trail of paperwork, of shell companies and nominees. A ghost hunt. If you want to find the body, you start with the gravedigger. You find the man who made the problem—the surveyor—disappear.”

“How?”

“You ask the people who are good at not being seen.” Malachy stood up. “I’ll make a call. One call. After that, you’re on your own. This isn’t a confessional matter anymore. It’s a street matter.”

He moved to the corner of the office, to an old, black rotary phone on a stand. He dialled a number from memory, the clicks loud and deliberate in the quiet room. He turned his back, his voice dropping to a low murmur Donnie couldn’t decipher.

Donnie looked down at the ledger. He opened it again, to the page with his father’s name. *J. McCallum. Labour. River Lot 7b. Oct-Nov ’82.* Just an entry. A line of ink. But he could feel the ghost of the cash in his father’s hand, the grit under his nails, the look he must have given a faulty weld or a shallow foundation. A look that asked a question.

Malachy hung up. He turned, his face grim. “There’s a man. He drinks in a place called the *Crow’s Nest*, down in the Broomielaw. Not the pretty bit. The bit behind the old freight sheds. He’ll be there after nine. Ask for Tam. Tell him Mal sent you. Ask him about surveyors. Don’t mention the ledger. Don’t mention O’Donnell.”

“What will that get me?”

“A direction. Maybe a name. Maybe a warning.” Malachy met his eye. “He’s a useful man, Tam. He’s also a frightened one. The two often go together.”

*

The rain had settled into a fine, persistent mist by the time Donnie left the church. It hung in the air, beading on the wool of his coat, glossing the cobbles of the High Street. The ledger was back in the boot of his car, wrapped in a plastic bag from a newsagent. It felt no lighter.

He drove without purpose, the wipers sweeping a semi-circle of clarity across the glass. The city unspooled outside—the grand, sooted Victorian buildings giving way to the sixties concrete of the motorway, then to the low, bleak sprawl of the industrial riverside. He passed the SECC, its armadillo shell gleaming wetly under the orange streetlights, and kept going, into the older, darker gut of the Clyde.

The Broomielaw here was a forgotten corridor. The grand plans for waterfront apartments had petered out. The chain-link fences enclosed rubble and weeds. The *Crow’s Nest* was a low, bunker-like building squatted between a derelict customs shed and a haulage yard still clinging to life. Its neon sign was half dead, spelling *C*RO*W*S *N*ST. The light bled into the mist.

Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale beer, fried food, and damp. The lighting was a dull brown, leaching colour from everything. A handful of men were scattered at tables or along the bar, each sitting in their own pool of isolation. Conversations were low, monosyllabic. The barman, a thick-set man with a tattooed scalp, watched the door with the blank gaze of a security camera.

Donnie went to the bar. The smell of old cooking oil was stronger here. “Pint of heavy.”

The barman pulled it without a word, placed it on a sodden beer mat. Donnie laid a note down. “I’m looking for Tam.”

The barman’s eyes flickered over him, taking in the coat, the shoes, the face that didn’t belong. He gave a barely perceptible nod towards the back, past the gantry, where a narrow corridor led to the toilets and a fire door.

Donnie took his pint and walked. The corridor was darker, the floor sticky. A single bulb in a wire cage illuminated a heavy door marked PRIVATE. He knocked.

A moment passed. Then it opened a crack. A face appeared, gaunt, pale, the skin stretched tight over sharp cheekbones. Eyes the colour of dishwater darted over Donnie. “What?”

“Mal sent me.”

The eyes narrowed. The door opened wider. “Get in.”

The room was an office of sorts. A desk buried under invoices and delivery notes. A safe, old and green, in the corner. A kettle on a filing cabinet. Tam closed the door and leaned against it, folding his arms. He was whip-thin, dressed in jeans and a faded black polo shirt. He didn’t offer a seat.

“Mal doesn’t send many,” Tam said. His voice was raspy, as if from disuse. “What’s your business?”

“Information. About a surveyor. One who went missing, maybe around ’84, ’85.”

Tam didn’t move, but something shifted behind his eyes. A shutter coming down. “Don’t know any surveyors.”

“This one worked on river lots. Before they were redeveloped.”

“A lot of the river got redeveloped. Or didn’t.” Tam pushed off the door and went to the kettle, his back to Donnie. “That’s a long time ago. Memories get muddy.”

“This memory has a price on it,” Donnie said, keeping his voice level. “I’m not polis. I’m not press. I’m the son of a man who took O’Donnell work.”

The name hung in the small, stuffy room. Tam froze, his hand on the kettle. He didn’t turn around for a long count. When he did, his face was carefully blank, but a muscle ticked in his jaw. “That’s a name you shouldn’t use. Even here.”

“It’s the name that’s in the ledger next to my father’s. And next to a river lot that had a surveyor’s report go missing.”

Tam let out a slow breath, almost a whistle. He looked at Donnie properly for the first time, assessing the weight of him, the set of his shoulders. “Your father. He have an accident?”

“He did.”

A nod. Tam seemed to reach a decision. He gestured to a rickety chair in front of the desk. Donnie sat. Tam remained standing, leaning against the desk, putting himself higher.

“O’Donnell wasn’t a person,” Tam began, echoing Malachy but with a harder edge. “It was a system. A way of getting things done without the paperwork, the taxes, the… scrutiny. For a while, it was almost noble. A black-market welfare state for tradesmen. Then the property boys caught the scent. They saw the riverfront, all that derelict land owned by the council or in receivership, and they saw gold. But to get the gold, you needed the land cheap. And to get it cheap, you needed the surveys to say it was problematic. Unstable. Contaminated. Or you needed the one that said it was fine to go missing, so a cheaper, nastier one could take its place.”

“You worked for them.”

“I was a facilitator,” Tam said, the term clearly well-worn. “I found the labour. I arranged the transport. I made sure the right palms were greased and the wrong eyes weren’t looking. I was good at it. I didn’t ask what I was facilitating.” He lit a cigarette, the flame of his lighter trembling slightly. “The surveyor you’re asking about. His name was Kieran Walsh. Conscientious. Young. Had a wife, a wean on the way. He did the work for Lot 7b. Found it was solid. Good bedrock. No major issues. His report was worth a fortune to the wrong people, because it meant the council couldn’t sell it for scrap.”

“What happened to him?”

“He was supposed to hand over his findings, all his notes, to his firm. He was uneasy. He’d seen men on the site at night, men who weren’t from any firm he knew. He made a copy. A safety copy.” Tam took a long drag. “He told the wrong person he’d done it. A mate, he thought. A mate who drove a digger for O’Donnell.”

The story unfolded with a terrible, grinding inevitability. Walsh was approached. A thick envelope of cash was offered for the original and the copy. He refused. He threatened to go to the authorities. The mate was told to sort it, to get the copy back, to scare him straight.

“It was meant to be a talking-to,” Tam said, his voice dropping to a whisper. “Down a lane. But Walsh was scared, he fought back. The lad panicked. He had a wrench in his hand from fixing a hydraulic line on his machine earlier. It wasn’t meant to happen.” He stubbed the cigarette out, half-smoked. “But it did.”

Donnie felt the cold from the ledger seep into his bones. “And the body?”

“The Clyde takes what it’s given,” Tam said, his eyes empty. “It was high. It was fast. It was the end of the story.”

“For Walsh.”

“Aye. For Walsh. The lad who swung the wrench… he got a promotion. Foreman on a big site out by the airport. Drove a new Ford Orion. Lasted six months before he wrapped it around a bridge support on the M8. No skid marks. They said he fell asleep at the wheel.” Tam looked directly at Donnie. “That’s how O’Donnell works. It’s a self-cleaning oven. Any mess, any loose end, the heat finds it and burns it away.”

“Who gave the order? To get the report, to scare Walsh?”

Tam shook his head. “You’re not listening. There’s no *who*. It’s a chain. A whisper from a suit in an office to a site manager, to a gaffer, to a lad with a wrench and a debt. The suit doesn’t know the lad’s name. The lad doesn’t know the suit’s face. The only thing that connects them is the work. The profit.”

“And the ledger.”

Tam’s face went still. “You have it?”

“I’ve seen it.”

“Then you have a target on your back you don’t even know about. That ledger is the one piece of physical connection. Names, dates, payments. It’s the one thread that could, if you pulled it hard enough, maybe start to unravel the whole sweater.” He stood up abruptly. “You need to lose it. Or give it back to Malachy to lock in his hellish vault forever.”

“My father’s name is in it.”

“And he’s dead! You want your name in the next one?” Tam’s composure cracked, showing the raw fear beneath. “They’re not ghosts from the eighties, son. The system evolved. The suits got better suits. The money got cleaner, washing through offshore accounts and development funds. But the mechanism is the same. A problem arises, the heat is applied. You are now a problem. A man asking about Walsh, about O’Donnell, with a ledger. You’re a walking loose end.”

He went to the door, opened it. The dismal noise of the pub filtered in. “The man who took over the system in the nineties, who made it corporate, who made it *respectable*… they call him the Factor. He doesn’t get his hands dirty. He factors in the cost of problems, and he pays to have them removed. If you’re determined to dig, that’s the name you’ll hear in certain circles. But hearing it is one thing. Finding him is another. And finding him is the last thing you’ll ever do.”

Donnie stood. The pint glass on the desk was still full, the head collapsed into a yellowed foam. “Why are you telling me this?”

“Because Mal asked. And because I liked your old man. I met him once or twice. He had a good laugh. He didn’t deserve his end.” Tam’s gaze was bleak. “And maybe because I’ve been waiting thirty years for someone to come asking. The waiting wears you down. Now get out. And don’t come back.”

*

Donnie drove through the mist-shrouded streets, Tam’s words coiling in his gut like smoke. *The Factor.* A title, not a name. A function. The final piece of the machine that had consumed his father and a man named Kieran Walsh. It was colder, more impersonal than he’d imagined. His father hadn’t been killed by a villain, but by a cost-benefit analysis. A line item.

He found himself parked outside his father’s old house in Govan. The tenement was still there, the stone darkened by decades of rain and exhaust. The windows of his old flat were dark. New people lived there now, people with no memory of the man who’d once whistled on the landing, his toolbag slung over his shoulder.

This was the inheritance. Not a mystery to be solved, but a machine to be understood. A machine that was still running, polished and efficient, somewhere in the glass-and-steel heart of the new city growing along the river. The river that had taken the evidence.

His mobile phone buzzed in his pocket, a violent shiver in the quiet car. He didn’t recognise the number.

“Aye.”

“Donnie? It’s Moira.” Her voice was tight, strained. “I’m at the shop. You need to come. Now.”

“What’s wrong?”

“Just come. And Donnie… come round the back. Don’t use the front.”

The line went dead.

He threw the car into gear, the tyres hissing on the wet tarmac. The drive to the Shawlands was a blur of traffic lights and looming buildings. A cold, specific dread had replaced the generalised weight. The machine knew his name.

He parked two streets over, approached the back of the row of shops through a service lane clogged with bins. The mist had thickened, clinging to the brickwork. The back door to Moira’s bookshop was ajar, a thin blade of yellow light cutting across the damp asphalt.

He pushed it open. The storeroom was in chaos. Boxes of books had been ripped open, their contents spilling across the floor in avalanches of paper. Filing cabinet drawers hung open, empty. Moira stood amidst the wreckage, her arms wrapped around herself. Her face was pale, her eyes wide.

“They were here an hour ago,” she said, her voice trembling with a forced calm. “Two men. Polite, she said. Asked to see the back stock, the rare collections. Mrs. Dalziel let them in—she was minding the till for me. They came back here. Ten minutes later, they left. She thought nothing of it until I came in and found this.”

Donnie stepped further in. The destruction was meticulous, not violent. It was a search. “Did they take anything?”

“I don’t know. It’s hard to tell. But they weren’t looking for books, Donnie.” She pointed a shaking finger at the far wall. The small, framed photograph of his father and the other men on the oil platform was gone. The nail it had hung on was bare.

“They asked about you,” Moira said, the words dropping like stones. “Casually. If you were still a regular. If you’d been in lately. If you’d ever left anything here for safekeeping.”

The chill in the room was absolute. They hadn’t found the ledger at the church. They were checking all his known haunts. The machine was tracing his connections. It was factoring him in.

He looked at the devastation, the violated quiet of Moira’s sanctuary. He saw the fear in her eyes, fear he had brought to her doorstep. The weight of his inheritance was no longer his alone to carry. It was spreading, a stain.

“You need to go, Moira. Go to your sister’s in Stirling. Tonight.”

“What have you stepped in, Donnie?”

“Something old,” he said, his voice low. “Something that never died. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”

He helped her gather a few things, his movements mechanical. His mind was already elsewhere, turning over the new facts. They were looking for the ledger. They knew he had it, or suspected. They were watching, probing. The *Clansman* would be next. His flat. There was no safe shelf to leave this on anymore.

He waited with her until her taxi came, loading a small case into the boot. She held his arm at the door, her grip fierce. “You’re not your father, Donnie. Don’t try to be. Be smarter.”

He watched the tail lights disappear into the gloom. Then he turned and walked back into the ravaged storeroom. He righted a fallen chair and sat in the centre of the chaos, surrounded by the scattered pages of other people’s stories.

The hook was in him now, deep. It was no longer about knowing the weight. It was about bearing it. And the only way to bear it was to turn and face the current, not with the hot rage of a wronged son, but with the cold, precise determination of a man who finally understood the mechanism he was up against.

He took out his phone. He had one name. A title. The Factor.

He had a ledger, a weapon he didn’t yet know how to use.

And he had, somewhere in the city, a counterpart. A man in a good suit who had just authorised a search of a bookshop, who was now factoring in the cost of Donnie McCallum.

The game was no longer quiet. It was declared.

He sat in the light of the single bare bulb, listening to the distant hum of the city, and began to think not like a man uncovering the past, but like a man planning for a war.

# Chapter 15

## **CHAPTER 15**

The *Clansman* in the morning light was a different beast. The rain had stopped, leaving the pavements slick and the air tasting of wet concrete and diesel. The greasy smear was gone, replaced by a hard, clear glare that showed every crack in the stone, every cigarette butt in the gutter. Donnie stood across the street, in the lee of a shuttered newsagent’s, and watched his own front door.

He’d been there for an hour. He’d watched the postie come and go, a bundle of brown envelopes and flyers for takeaways shoved through the brass letterbox. He’d watched Mrs. Crenshaw from the first floor lean out to haul in her milk, her floral housecoat a bright shock against the grey. Normal. Quiet. It was the quiet that bothered him. It felt like a held breath.

Moira’s words were a cold stone in his gut. *Be smarter.* He wasn’t his father. Rab McCallum would have shouldered through that door last night, a bottle in one hand and a blind fury in the other, ready to meet whatever was waiting head-on. It was a kind of courage, but it was a stupid one. It was the courage that got you a shiv in the kidneys in a close mouth, or a bullet from a shadow. Donnie had inherited the weight, but not the method. Not anymore.

He saw it then. A flicker of movement in the first-floor window of the tenement opposite. Not a face, just a shift in the darkness behind the net curtain. A stillness that was too complete, then broken. A watcher. Professional enough not to press against the glass, amateur enough to move during a surveillance shift. The Factor’s man. Or the police. In this city, the line between the two had always been a faint, smudged pencil mark.

Donnie turned his collar up and walked away, not towards the pub, but east, towards the Gallowgate proper. He moved with the loose, unhurried gait of a man with nowhere in particular to be, his hands deep in the pockets of his jacket. The ledger was a hard, rectangular presence against his ribs, wrapped in a plastic bag from the chippy. He’d slept with it under his mattress in a different B&B, a place with sticky carpets and the smell of old frying, listening to the arguments through the walls. It wasn’t safe. Nothing was safe. It was a piece of a machine, and he needed to understand the gears.

He needed Frankie Boyle.

Frankie wasn’t in the phone book. Frankie was a rumour, a whisper in certain bars after a certain hour. He was the man who knew where the pipes ran, not just the water pipes, but the other ones. The money pipes. The information pipes. He’d been a council planner for thirty years before taking a redundancy that everyone knew was a pay-off to look the other way during the Buchanan Galleries development. Now he drank alone in the back snug of the *Horseshoe Bar*, a living archive of Glasgow’s guts.

Donnie found him there, just after opening. The bar was a tomb of polished mahogany and mirrored glass, smelling of bleach and last night’s beer. Frankie was a small man in a large overcoat, sitting with a half-pint of lager and a racing post, his glasses perched on the end of a veined nose. He didn’t look up as Donnie slid into the seat opposite.

“Frankie.”

“McCallum.” Frankie turned a page. His voice was a dry rustle, like leaves on pavement. “Heard you were asking after me. Bad for my health, that.”

“I need a history lesson.”

“Try the Mitchell Library.”

“This history isn’t in books.”

Frankie took a slow sip of his lager, his eyes never leaving the form guide. “Aye. I heard about Moira’s place. Messy. Not how it’s done.”

“How is it done?”

“Quietly.” Frankie finally looked at him. His eyes were pale, watery, the colour of a winter sky. “You don’t turn over a bookshop. You turn over the owner. A word in a shell-like. A photograph of a grandchild coming out of school. A reminder about a gambling debt they didn’t know you knew about. What happened was a statement. They wanted you to know they’d been. They wanted you to feel it.”

Donnie felt the cold stone in his gut grow heavier. “The Factor.”

Frankie’s expression didn’t change, but a muscle in his jaw twitched. He folded his paper with precise, careful movements. “That’s a name that hasn’t been said out loud in a long time. Not since your da’s day.”

“Tell me.”

“It’s not a man, son. It’s a job. A function. Like a janitor for a dirty building.” Frankie leaned forward, his voice dropping. “Back in the day, when the merchant city boys wanted a problem solved—a tenant who wouldn’t move, a rival business that needed leaning on, a vote that needed securing—they didn’t get their own hands dirty. They spoke to the Factor. The Factor arranged it. He factored in the cost. Labour, materials, silence. He was the buffer. The layer of insulation between the respectability and the reality.”

“And my father?”

Frankie sat back, his gaze drifting to the optics behind the bar. “Rab was a tool. A good one. Reliable. Had a fire in him that could be directed. The Factor directed it. For a while. But your da… he had a line. A stupid, sentimental line. He started to see the people behind the problems. Started asking for more money, or refusing certain jobs. He thought he was a partner. He was a wrench. And you don’t negotiate with a wrench. You replace it.”

The words hung in the air between them, clinical and brutal. Donnie saw it, not as a betrayal, but as a mechanical failure. A part wearing out.

“Who is he now?”

Frankie laughed, a short, dry bark. “You think I know? That’s the point. The name, the face, it changes. The function remains. It’s a title passed down, like a bad watch. Probably some smooth cunt in a glass office in Finnieston now, outsourcing the rough stuff to Albanians or Poles. The principle’s the same. You’re a loose end, Donnie. Your da’s ledger is a loose end. They’re tidying up.”

“How do you fight a function?”

“You don’t.” Frankie finished his drink. “You break the machine. Find the one thing the machine can’t afford to lose. Its money. Its reputation. Its peace.” He stood up, pulling his overcoat tight. “But you need leverage. That ledger… it’s just a list of symptoms. You need the diagnosis. You need the bank.”

Donnie frowned. “What bank?”

“The one that held the slush. The one that moved the payments. The Factor’s money wouldn’t be in a mattress. It’d be in a vault, with a fancy name and discreet bankers. Your da was muscle, not accounts. But he was meticulous. If there’s a pattern in that book, it’ll point to where the money came from, and where it went. Follow the stain.”

Frankie touched the brim of an imaginary hat and shuffled out of the snug, leaving Donnie alone with the smell of old wood and the low hum of the fridge.

The bank. It was a thread, fine as spider silk, but a thread. Donnie left the *Horseshoe* and walked north, towards the city centre. The ledger was a live thing against his side. He found a quiet café, ordered a coffee he didn’t drink, and spread the photocopied pages on the table under the guise of studying a map.

He looked at it with new eyes. Not for the names of the victims, but for the rhythm of the crime. Dates. Amounts. Initials. Rab’s tight, angry script. He saw the abbreviations: *CTax* for a crippling council tax debt suddenly paid. *R&M* for repairs and maintenance never done. *Sec.* for security. And beside some of the larger sums, a code. *C.C.B.*

He sat back. City and Colonial Bank. It had been swallowed by a bigger English bank in the nineties, its grand sandstone building on St. Vincent Street turned into a wine bar. But thirty years ago, it was where the old money kept its accounts. Discreet. Scottish.

The hook was in him, deep. He was following the current now, not fighting it. He needed to see the records. He needed a way into a dead bank’s past.

He thought of Archie. Archie knew everyone. But involving Archie was painting a target on his back. He thought of the man in the good suit. He would be watching Archie, too.

He paid for his coffee and walked out, the pages folded away. The afternoon was fading, the hard light softening into a dull bronze. He found himself outside the Eastern Necropolis, the high Victorian gates standing open. He went in.

The cemetery was a city of the dead on a hill, overlooking the living one. Granite angels watched with sightless eyes. The paths were damp gravel, crunching under his feet. He didn’t know where he was going until he was there.

The stone was simple, clean. No angel, no verse. Just a name and two dates.
**RAB McCALLUM**
**1958 – 1992**
**Gone but not forgotten.**

The *but not forgotten* was Moira’s addition, paid for with her own money after the funeral the council had provided. The earth had long since settled. Someone had left a fresh bunch of daffodils in a stone jar, the yellow a violent shock against the grey. Moira. She must have come before they trashed her shop.

Donnie stood before the grave. He didn’t speak. There were no words left between them that weren’t already etched in the ledger’s pages. He was here for the silence. For the reminder of what the end of this road looked like. A patch of grass on a hill. A date.

“He was a bastard, you know.”

The voice came from behind him. Donnie didn’t turn. He knew it. Smooth. Educated. The man from the suit.

“He was also a useful bastard,” the voice continued. A man stepped into view, keeping a respectful distance. He wore a different suit today, charcoal, just as expensive. He held his own bunch of flowers—white lilies, cellophane-wrapped. He placed them carefully beside Moira’s daffodils. “A blunt instrument in a time that required bluntness. The city was a messy place. He helped clean it up.”

Donnie finally looked at him. He was younger than he’d seemed in the dim light of the bookshop, mid-forties, with the careful, maintained look of a man who used a personal trainer. His face was neutral, pleasant even.

“The Factor sends his condolences,” the man said.

“Is that you?”

The man smiled, a thin, professional stretching of the lips. “I’m an associate. A facilitator. You can call me Mr. Grant.”

“What do you want, Grant?”

“The ledger, Donnie. It’s an antique. Of historical interest, perhaps, but not of practical use. Its time has passed. Hand it over, and the inconveniences stop. Moira can return to her books. Your pub can remain yours. You can walk away from the weight.”

“And if I don’t?”

Grant’s smile didn’t waver, but his eyes cooled, like two chips of flint. “Then you become a practical problem. And we have a department for that. A much less diplomatic department. Your father met them, in the end. It’s why he’s here.”

The threat was delivered like the weather forecast. A matter of fact.

“The City and Colonial Bank,” Donnie said, watching him.

A flicker. A tiny, almost imperceptible tightening around the eyes. The first crack in the smooth façade. “A dead institution. Irrelevant.”

“Is it?”

Grant studied him, reassessing. The blunt instrument’s son was not so blunt. “You’re smarter than he was. That’s good. It means you can see the logic. The ledger is a liability. For you, for everyone named in it. Some of those people are still around. They have grandchildren now. Good jobs. They won’t thank you for raking over the past. Give it to me. Let the past stay buried.”

“It’s not buried,” Donnie said, looking at his father’s grave. “It’s just waiting.”

Grant sighed, a sound of genuine disappointment. “I had hoped we could be civilised. The offer is on the table for forty-eight hours. After that, the offer changes. The cost goes up.” He nodded once, a polite, funeral gesture, and turned to walk away down the path, his shoes clicking neatly on the gravel.

Donnie watched him go until he disappeared around a towering monument to a shipping magnate. The cold in his gut had solidified into a core of ice. They’d known he’d come here. They were always a step ahead, because they knew the map. They’d drawn it.

He looked down at the two bunches of flowers side by side. Moira’s brave, bright daffodils. Grant’s cold, funereal lilies. The past and the present, lying together on the same dirt.

He turned and walked out of the necropolis, the dead at his back. The city sprawled below him, a circuit board of streets and intentions. He had a name now. Grant. He had a bank. C.C.B. He had a deadline.

He didn’t go back to the B&B. He went to the Mitchell Library after all. He sat in the hushed, grand reading room under the dome, surrounded by ghosts of words, and he requested the microfiche records for the *Herald* and the *Evening Times* from 1988 to 1992. He looked for anything on the City and Colonial Bank. Mergers. Scandals. Retirements.

He found it in a small, back-page piece from October 1991. A senior manager, Alistair Cochrane, had taken early retirement. The article was anodyne, praising his service. But in the grainy photograph, Donnie saw a face he recognized. Softer, younger, but the same careful eyes. Speaking at a charity dinner. The caption called him a pillar of the financial community.

Alistair Cochrane. Mr. Grant’s real name.

The thread had a fibre. A person. A man who had retired from a bank and found a new line of work as a facilitator. A man who knew where the old bodies were buried because he’d helped pay for the graves.

The light in the reading room faded. The librarians began to switch off lamps. Donnie sat in the gathering dark, the hum of the city outside replaced by the deeper silence of stored knowledge.

He had a name. He had a target. Not a function, but a man. A man with a past, with a life, with things to lose.

The war was no longer abstract. It had a face. And Donnie McCallum, sitting alone under the library dome, began to plan his first, cold, precise move. He would not wait for the forty-eight hours to expire. He would visit Mr. Alistair Cochrane. He would show him that the past wasn’t a ledger to be closed, but a tide coming in. And he would make him feel its weight, bone-deep and cold.

# Chapter 16

## **CHAPTER 16**

The house in Bearsden was a monument to quiet money. It wasn’t the flash of Newton Mearns, all glass and angles shouting at the hills. This was a different grammar. Red sandstone, solid as a law firm’s handshake, set back from the road behind a screen of mature beeches. The gravel on the drive was raked into perfect, silent waves. A single security light, tastefully shielded, glowed above a dark-green door. It spoke of dividends, not deals. Of inherited portfolios and golf club memberships that required more than a cheque to secure.

Donnie stood across the road, in the shadow of a high garden wall. The rain here was different from the Gallowgate. It fell straight, a discreet curtain, washing the already-clean pavements. It didn’t smear; it polished. He’d taken two buses and a long, observant walk to get here, his senses sandpapered raw. The name *Alistair Cochrane* had buzzed in his skull all night, a wasp in a jar. He’d slept in fits on a hard chair in a 24-hour café in Partick, the smell of stale fryer oil and weak tea his only comfort. He wasn’t waiting for Grant’s deadline. He was rewriting the timetable.

He’d done his homework in the library’s dying light. Property records. Electoral roll. Cochrane had lived here since 1993. A move made two years after his ‘early retirement’. A step up, a step away. Donnie watched the house. No movement behind the wide bay windows. A Volvo estate, dark blue, sat on the drive. Sensible. Reliable. The car of a man who calculated risk for a living.

He crossed the road, his footsteps lost in the whisper of the rain on the beeches. He didn’t go to the front door. That was for deliveries and neighbours. He followed the side path, a narrow gully of damp stone between the house and a high fence, leading to the back garden. A sensor light blinked on, harsh and sudden. He froze, a statue in the white glare. He counted. Ten seconds. Twenty. It clicked off, plunging him back into the wet dark. He moved on.

The back garden was a large, ordered rectangle of lawn, bordered by meticulously pruned rose beds, bare now and spiked with canes. A patio with expensive-looking wrought-iron furniture, a cushion soaked through and sagging. A shed that looked tidier than most city flats. And a back door, painted the same dark green, with a large pane of glass in its upper half.

Donnie peered inside. A utility room. A washing machine, a dryer, shelves with neat rows of cleaning products. A dog’s lead hung on a hook, but no bowl on the floor. A house that had moved on from pets. Beyond, a glimpse of a warm, tiled kitchen. A kettle. A toaster. A normal life, laid out like a stage set.

He tried the handle. Locked. A standard Yale. He took the small, flat leather case from his inside pocket. Archie’s lessons, from a lifetime ago in a different kind of war: *The lock’s no’ a secret, son. It’s a suggestion. You just need to be more persuasive than the spring*. The tools were cold in his fingers. He worked by feel, his ear close to the mechanism, listening for the whisper of the pins yielding. The rain dripped from his hair onto the glass. A click, soft as a knuckle cracking. He turned the handle. The door opened with a sigh of damp-swollen wood.

The smell hit him first. Not a bad smell. The opposite. Lemon polish, floor cleaner, the faint, sweet ghost of fabric conditioner. A smell of relentless, hired order. He stepped inside, closing the door softly behind him. The utility room was spotless. The kitchen was a showroom. No dishes in the sink. No crumbs on the counter. A fruit bowl held three apples, polished to a waxy sheen. It felt like no one lived here. It felt like a house that was waiting to be photographed for a brochure.

He moved through the ground floor. Dining room with a table that could seat ten, not a placemat out of place. A formal living room, antiques that looked genuinely old, upholstery in muted creams and greens. A bookcase filled with leather-bound volumes that had likely never been opened. A study.

Donnie paused at the study door. This was the room. The brain of the operation. He pushed the door open.

It was, like everything else, orderly. A large, mahogany desk. A banker’s lamp with a green glass shade. A blotter. A silver pen in a stand. A photograph in a silver frame: a younger Cochrane, a woman with a careful smile, two children in stiff clothes, all posed in front of a loch. A happy family, frozen in generic bliss. The books here were different: financial histories, biographies of industrialists, a few hardback thrillers. Nothing personal. No diaries. No letters.

He tried the desk drawers. Locked. A different lock. Heavier. He used a different tool, his hands steady. The first drawer slid open. Stationery. Embossed with the address. The second: files. Household bills. Insurance documents. All meticulously organised. The third, the deep bottom drawer, was heavier. It resisted, then gave.

Inside were not files, but memories. Or rather, the artefacts of a discarded life. A brass nameplate: *Alistair Cochrane, Senior Manager, City & Colonial Bank*. A few old annual reports from the bank. And a single, thick, cardboard-bound photograph album.

Donnie lifted it out. He sat in the high-backed leather chair, the chair that sighed under his weight like a tired old man. He opened the album.

The first pages were personal. The family from the framed photo, but in less formal shots. Holidays. Christmases. The children growing. Then, halfway through, the tone shifted. Bank functions. Black-tie dinners. Golf days. Groups of men in suits, smiling with a confidence that came from owning the world, or at least a profitable slice of it. Donnie turned the pages slowly, his finger tracing the faces.

He found him. A younger Cochrane, hair thicker, waist slimmer, standing with a group of other men. The caption, written in neat white ink below: *C.C.B. Annual Charity Gala, 1989*. Donnie recognised others. Councillors. A few faces from the business pages of the time. And there, on the edge of the group, his smile not quite reaching his eyes, a man with a sharp, intelligent face and a watch that even in the faded photograph looked expensive.

Rory Finlay.

Donnie’s breath stilled in his chest. The connection was there, in glossy print. Cochrane and Finlay, sharing a frame, a night, a purpose. The banker and the developer. The facilitator and the beneficiary. It wasn’t proof, not of murder, not of conspiracy. But it was a thread, now woven into a visible pattern.

He heard a sound. A key, scratching at the front door lock.

He closed the album silently, replaced it in the drawer, pushed it shut. He was out of the study door in two strides, melting into the shadowed hallway just as the front door swung open.

Light from the street spilled in, outlining a figure. Alistair Cochrane. He was older than his photograph, of course. Heavier, his face looser, but the careful eyes were the same. He wore a tan raincoat, unbuttoned. He was humming something tuneless under his breath. He shut the door, locked it with a deliberate double-turn of the key. He shrugged off his coat, hung it on a polished stand. He bent to pick up a single letter from the mat, slipping it into his inside pocket without looking at it.

He moved into the kitchen, his footsteps firm on the tiles. Donnie heard the clink of a kettle, the tap running. The normal, comforting sounds of homecoming.

Donnie didn’t move. He stood in the dark of the hallway, near the foot of the stairs. He was a patch of deeper shadow. He let Cochrane make his tea. Let him have that one moment of peace.

The kitchen light went out. Cochrane walked back into the hallway, a mug in his hand, heading for the study. He reached for the door handle.

“Don’t,” Donnie said.

The word was flat, quiet. It hung in the warm, scented air like a shard of ice.

Cochrane jerked as if he’d touched a live wire. The mug slipped from his hand. It hit the Persian runner with a dull thud, tea blooming across the intricate patterns like a brown stain. He spun around, his eyes wide, searching the darkness.

“Who’s there?”

“Put the light on,” Donnie said. “The hall light. Slowly.”

Cochrane fumbled for the switch. A warm, low glow from a brass sconce filled the hallway. It illuminated Donnie, standing by the newel post, his hands loose at his sides. It illuminated Cochrane, his face pale, his eyes darting from Donnie to the front door, calculating distance, odds.

“What do you want?” Cochrane’s voice was a strained version of its probable boardroom tone. “There’s money. In the study. Take it and go.”

“I don’t want your money, Mr. Cochrane.”

The use of his name did something to him. It wasn’t the shock of the intrusion anymore; it was a colder, deeper fear. His eyes narrowed, focusing properly on Donnie for the first time. He saw the age, the worn clothes, the stillness.

“Who are you?”

“A ghost,” Donnie said. He took a single step forward. “From the Gallowgate. From 1988.”

Cochrane’s mouth opened, then closed. A flicker of genuine confusion, then a dawning, awful recognition. It wasn’t recognition of Donnie’s face, but of the era. Of the context. His shoulders slumped, not in defeat, but in a weary understanding. The game, it seemed, was always the same, only the players changed.

“Grant sent you,” he said, the name a bitter taste.

“No. I’m sending a message *to* Grant. Through you.”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” The denial was automatic, polished. A first line of defence.

Donnie took another step. He was close enough now to smell the man. A faint trace of cologne, of the rain, of the tea on the rug. Underneath it, the sour tang of fear. “Alistair Cochrane. Retired 1991. Pillar of the community. Now a consultant. A facilitator. You tidy up messy problems for men like Rory Finlay. You found a new use for your banking skills. You don’t move money anymore. You move consequences.”

“You’re mad. Get out of my house.”

“You knew Moira McCallum.”

The name, spoken in that quiet, dead tone, stopped Cochrane’s breath. His eyes flickered towards the study, towards the drawer. “I knew a lot of people. A long time ago.”

“You knew her because your bank financed Finlay’s Gallowgate project. The one that needed the land she was sitting on. The one that needed her gone.”

“That was a legitimate development. It brought regeneration—”

“It brought a coffin,” Donnie said, his voice dropping to a whisper that cut through the man’s rehearsed lines. “She was murdered. Beaten to death in her own home. And you and Finlay and the rest of your pillars used the City and Colonial Bank to wash the blood off the money.”

Cochrane’s face was rigid. “Prove it.”

“I don’t need to prove it to a court. I just need to prove it to you.” Donnie gestured towards the study. “I’ve seen the album. 1989. You and Finlay, sharing a whisky and a scheme. You think that’s the only picture? You think memories only exist in photo albums? They exist in bricks. In empty lots. In people who don’t forget.”

“What do you want?” Cochrane asked again, but the question was different now. It was hollow.

“I want you to deliver a message. To Grant. You tell him the forty-eight hours are irrelevant. You tell him I’m not negotiating for my life. I’m conducting an audit. A retrospective one. And I’m starting with the senior management.” Donnie took the final step, now standing directly in front of the man. He was taller than Cochrane. He could see the pores on his nose, the tiny burst blood vessels in his cheeks. “You’re retired, Alistair. You have this house. That car. That family in the photograph. You have things that can be broken. Not by me. I won’t touch a hair on their heads. But by the tide. When it comes in, it doesn’t discriminate. It washes away foundations. It reveals what’s buried. Your name, your reputation, this quiet little life… it’s built on sand that’s about to get very, very wet.”

Cochrane’s defiance was crumbling. It was being replaced by a pragmatic, financial terror. He was a man who understood cost. “He’ll kill you. You know that, don’t you? Grant isn’t a banker. He’s something else.”

“I know what he is. And he needs to learn what I am.” Donnie leaned in, his final words a breath in the man’s ear. “You’re the message, Alistair. The first line of it. You tell him McCallum was here. You tell him the past isn’t a ledger. It’s a living thing. And it’s hungry.”

He stepped back. He turned and walked down the hallway towards the front door. He didn’t hurry. He could feel Cochrane’s eyes on his back, wide and unblinking.

Donnie unlocked the door, opened it. The cool, rain-washed air rushed in, a shock after the stifling warmth of the house. He didn’t look back. He stepped out into the night, pulling the door closed behind him with a soft, final click.

He walked down the raked gravel drive, the stones crunching softly under his feet. He didn’t look at the windows. He knew Cochrane would be standing in the hallway, still as the antiques, staring at the closed door, the stain on his rug, the terrifying, simple truth of the visit.

He had made his first move. Cold. Precise. It wasn’t violence. It was psychology. It was the application of pressure to a fault line. He had given Grant a problem: a loose end that was no longer just a name in a file, but a vector, a force moving in the world. And he had given Cochrane a choice: be the messenger, or be the next example.

The rain in Bearsden was still a polite drizzle. Donnie turned up his collar, not in the hunched, futile armour of the Gallowgate, but in a gesture of simple preparedness. The war had a face. And now, that face knew his name.

He vanished into the tree-lined dark, leaving the quiet house to its silent, trembling reckoning. The message was sent. The next move was Grant’s. And Donnie would be waiting, not in the shadows, but in the light of the past, which he was now turning, degree by careful degree, into a weapon.

# Chapter 17

## **CHAPTER 17**

The light in the Gallowgate the next morning was a grudging concession, a thin, washed-out yellow that did nothing to warm the stone. It found the cracks in the tenement facades and pooled in the hollows of the pavement, but it left the heart of the place untouched. Donnie walked through it, the taste of last night’s whisky a faint, metallic ghost at the back of his throat. He’d slept in his old room above the *Clansman*, the mattress a familiar topography of springs and dips. He’d woken with the dawn chorus of bin lorries and seagull shrieks, the city’s true reveille.

He’d sent the message. Now he had to wait for the echo. Waiting was an active thing. It was a tightening of the nerves, a calibration of the senses. You didn’t just sit. You listened. You watched the street for a pattern that broke. You felt for the tremor in the ground before the footfall.

His destination was a place for listening. The Mitchell Library wasn’t a retreat; it was an arsenal. Its great dome, green against the grey sky, was a fortress of fact. Donnie pushed through the heavy doors, the sudden hush a physical pressure after the street’s grumble. The air smelled of old paper, floor polish, and quiet desperation. He moved through the grand hall, past students bowed over laptops and pensioners turning the broadsheet pages with a dry rustle, a sound like autumn leaves.

He found a carrel in a corner of the Glasgow Room, a niche surrounded by the weight of local history. He wasn’t here for Grant. He knew Grant’s surface—the property portfolios, the holding companies, the charitable trusts with their clean, modern logos. That was the polished shell. Donnie needed the soft underbelly. He needed the men who weren’t on the board, the names that didn’t grace the annual reports. The muscle, the facilitators, the plumbers in the sleek financial infrastructure.

He started with the dead. Newspaper archives, microfiche reels whirring under his fingers, the past glowing in a ghostly green on the screen. He looked for the accidents. The drownings. The one-car crashes on lonely roads north of the city. The fires in lock-ups where the cause was never quite determined. He cross-referenced dates with known Grant deals that had hit snags—planning objections withdrawn, rival bids mysteriously pulled, witnesses who changed their testimony. He was looking for the punctuation in Grant’s rise. The full stops.

A name surfaced, then another. Not thugs. Not the tracksuit-and-trainers brigade. These were older, quieter men. A former soldier turned “security consultant” who’d died in a boating accident on Loch Lomond. A one-time accountant who’d specialised in liquidating difficult assets, found in his garage with the car engine running and no note. A publican from Bridgeton, a man who’d been a earner for the old McVie crew, who’d fallen down his own cellar steps the week after Grant acquired the land his pub stood on.

Donnie wrote the names in a small, black notebook, the biro scratching in the silence. He drew lines between them. He noted the methods. Clean. Distant. Plausible. This wasn’t the messy, emotional violence of the schemes. This was corporate sanitation. It had a chilling, efficient beauty to it.

He leaned back, the chair creaking. The library’s quiet hummed around him. He saw it now, the shape of Grant’s operation. A front of legitimate, aggressive business. A middle layer of financial alchemy and legal pressure. And beneath it, this deep, cold stratum of removal. A waste disposal service for human problems.

His mobile vibrated in his pocket, a dull buzz against his thigh. He didn’t recognise the number. A Glasgow code.

He let it ring three times, then answered, saying nothing.

A breath on the line. Then a voice, low, strained. “McCallum?”

Donnie recognised the tremor. Alistair Cochrane. “You got a new rug yet, Alistair?”

A choked sound, half-gasp, half-sob. “He knows. He called me. An hour ago.”

“What did he say?”

“He asked if I’d had any visitors. His voice was… calm. Too calm.” Cochrane’s words were tumbling out now, a whispered torrent. “I told him. I had to. He asked what you said. I told him that too. About the past being hungry.”

“And?”

“He said… he said ‘Thank you for the information, Alistair. That’s very helpful.’ Then he hung up.” The terror was liquid in the man’s voice. “He’s going to kill me. For telling you. For letting you in. He’s going to make it look like…”

“Like you topped yourself out of guilt?” Donnie finished, his voice flat. “Or had an accident with your antique letter opener?”

A whimper echoed down the line.

Donnie looked out at the rows of silent books, the histories of a thousand conflicts bound in leather and cloth. “He won’t touch you yet, Alistair. You’re still useful. You’re the canary. He’s put you back in the cage to see if you sing again, or if you just drop dead from the fear. If you die now, it tells him I got to you. It confirms you were a pressure point. He’ll wait. He’ll watch you. To see if you run. To see who you talk to.”

“What do I do?” It was a plea, stripped bare.

“You live your life. You go to your office. You have your dinner. You bleed fear, because that’s what he wants to smell. But you don’t run. Running is a confession.” Donnie paused, letting the silence stretch. “And if anyone new comes to your door, anyone offering you help or a way out, you call this number. They won’t be friends.”

He ended the call. The message had been received. And Grant’s first response was textbook: isolate the vector, assess its stability, monitor for further infection. He was treating Donnie like a virus. A manageable one.

Donnie left the library, stepping back into the pale daylight. The city felt different now. Not just a battlefield, but a diagnosed organism. He could see the healthy tissue—the shoppers, the workers, the kids on scooters. And he could sense the malignancy beneath, the quiet, systemic rot Grant represented. It wasn’t a tumour you could cut out; it had metastasised, woven into the very fabric of things.

He walked east, towards the Saltmarket. He needed a different kind of history now. Not the recorded kind, but the living kind, carried in the memory and the marrow.

The pub was called *The Lorne*, a narrow wedge of a place tucked between a shuttered discount store and a bookie’s. Its windows were nicotine-yellow, its paint peeling. It was a relic, a stubborn stone in the stream of progress. Donnie pushed the door open. The inside was a cave, smelling of stale beer, bleach, and old tobacco smoke ingrained in the wood. A handful of old men, their faces like carved peat, looked up from their pints, their eyes passing over him with the blank assessment of lifers.

Behind the bar, a man was polishing a glass with a slow, circular motion. He was in his late sixties, built like a barrel, with a shaved head and a nose that had been broken more than once. His arms were a tapestry of faded ink. He didn’t look up.

“Quiet,” Donnie said, leaning on the bar.

The barman placed the glass down. “It’s always quiet, son. That’s the point.” His eyes, a watery blue, finally lifted. They held no warmth, no recognition, just a flat, waiting patience. “What’s your poison?”

“Information.”

The man’s expression didn’t change. He picked up another glass. “This is a pub. We sell drink. Try the library.”

“The library’s for what’s written down. I’m after what’s remembered.” Donnie kept his voice low, even. “You’re Tam Grier.”

“I’m a man polishing a glass. You’re a man about to be shown the door.”

“You did a nine-stretch in Shotts for armed robbery. 1988. You were driver for the Campbell brothers on the North Kelvinside job.”

The polishing stopped. The blue eyes fixed on him, hard now. “That’s a long time ago. And a longer story.”

“I’m not interested in the job. I’m interested in what happened after. When Frank Campbell got out. When he tried to go straight, buy a little scrapyard in Possil. And when a property developer made him an offer he couldn’t refuse. An offer delivered by two men in suits who didn’t look like lawyers.”

Grier said nothing. He placed the glass on the shelf with exaggerated care.

“Frank turned them down,” Donnie continued. “A week later, a crusher in his yard malfunctioned. They found him in it. The investigation called it a tragic accident. A man who knew every inch of his own machinery.”

The silence in the pub was absolute now. The old men were statues, their pints forgotten.

“What’s your name, son?” Grier’s voice was a gravel whisper.

“McCallum.”

A flicker in the old eyes. A memory, stirring. “I knew a McCallum. A hard man from the Gallowgate. A different breed.”

“He was my father.”

Grier studied him for a long moment, then gave a slow, almost imperceptible nod. He reached under the bar, not for a weapon, but for a bottle of dark rum and two clean glasses. He poured two fingers into each, pushed one across the bar to Donnie.

“Frank was my cousin,” he said, lifting his own glass. “He was a daft bastard, but he was his own man. Those cunts in the suits… they were like ghosts. No fingerprints. No raised voices. Just a smile and a threat you felt in your bones.” He knocked the rum back, hissed through his teeth. “The big one, the talker. He had a thing. A mannerism. When he was making his point, he’d take off his glasses. Not to clean them. Just to hold them. He’d look at you over the rims, like you were a specimen. Cold as a January grave.”

Donnie drank. The rum was fire and molasses. “Did he have a name?”

“Not one he gave. But Frank, he was paranoid after they left. He followed one of them. The other one, the quiet one who just watched. Followed him to a gym. A fancy place in the West End. Not a boxin’ gym. One o’ they places with machines and mirrors.” Grier refilled his glass. “Frank said the quiet one met a man there. A fit-lookin’ bastard, early forties, dark hair. They talked like they knew each other. Frank took a picture. A shitty wee disposable camera thing. He gave me the negative for safekeeping. Said if anything happened to him…”

“You still have it?”

Grier’s smile was a thin, bitter cut. “For what? The polis? The papers? It was a picture of two men in trackies talkin’ in a car park. It was nothin’.” He poured more rum. “But I kept it. Sentiment. It’s in the back.”

He disappeared through a bead curtain. Donnie waited, feeling the weight of the old men’s stares. They weren’t hostile. They were custodial. They were guarding the last embers of a story the city had tried to forget.

Grier returned with a small, yellow Kodak envelope. He slid it across the bar. “It’s yours. I’m tired of keepin’ it. It’s a heavy thing, a memory with no use.”

Donnie took the envelope. He didn’t open it. The weight was indeed tangible. It was a fossil. A tiny, captured moment of the mechanism at work.

“The talker. The one with the glasses. You ever see him again? Hear a name?”

Grier shook his head. “He was a tool. Sharp, but disposable. The other one, the quiet one from the gym… I saw *him*. Years later. On the telly. In the background at some charity golf thing Grant was sponsoring. He was wearin’ a suit, standin’ beside him. Not a bodyguard. Closer. An aide.”

The connection snapped into place, cold and solid. The quiet man was the link. The operator who moved between the world of suits and the world of clean, permanent solutions. A fixture in Grant’s orbit.

Donnie finished his rum, placed a twenty on the bar. “For your time.”

Grier left the note where it lay. “That’s not for my time, son. That’s for the wake. You’re stirrin’ up the dead. They don’t like that. And the men who put them down… they like it even less.”

Donnie left *The Lorne*, the envelope a square of potential in his inside pocket. The pale sun had vanished, swallowed by a blanket of low, fast-moving cloud. The wind had picked up, snatching at litter in the gutters. He walked without a clear destination, processing.

He had a name from the archives. He had a face, or the negative of one, in his pocket. He had a method. He had Grant’s response pattern. He was building a map of the darkness. But a map wasn’t a weapon. It was just a guide.

He found himself on the edge of Glasgow Green, the vast, flat expanse of grass leading down to the grey curl of the Clyde. The People’s Palace, its glass dome dull in the flat light, stood at the far end. A place of civic history. He thought of the stories inside, the exhibits of tenement life, of protest, of community. The official story.

His story, the one he was piecing together, was the subtext. The violence that underwrote the peace. The fear that funded the progress.

His phone buzzed again. This time, it was Archie.

“Where are you?” Archie’s voice was tight, stripped of its usual gruff warmth.

“The Green. What’s wrong?”

“You need to get off the street. Now.” A pause, the sound of traffic in the background. “Two detectives. CID. They were at the *Clansman*. Asking for you. Not about the old stuff. New stuff.”

“What new stuff?”

“Alistair Cochrane. He’s dead.”

The wind off the river was suddenly icy. It cut through Donnie’s jacket. “How?”

“Found in his study an hour ago. Apparent suicide. Hanged himself with his own silk dressing gown cord from the banister.” Archie’s breath was harsh. “But here’s the thing, Donnie. They weren’t treating it as routine. They were asking where you were last night. They knew you were there. They had a description. A neighbour saw a man matching you leaving the property late. They’re calling you a ‘person of interest’. They want to talk. Friendly-like, for now.”

Grant’s move. Faster, harder than Donnie had anticipated. He hadn’t waited to monitor. He had cut the canary’s throat and left it in the cage. A clear, brutal signal. *This is the cost of touching my things.* And he had woven Donnie into the crime scene with elegant, malicious simplicity. The visit was now a precursor to a suicide. Or something else.

“The polis,” Archie said, the word heavy with implication. “They’re clean?”

“They’re following a lead. A solid one. Grant doesn’t own them. He just feeds them information. Tidy information.” Donnie watched a dog chase a ball across the endless green, its owner a small figure in the distance. The mundane world, rolling on. “Where are you?”

“In the car. I’ll pick you up. Not at the Green. The old swimming baths on Maitland Street. Ten minutes.”

Donnie ended the call. He stood for a moment, letting the reality settle. He was no longer just a man with a grievance. He was a suspect. A thread Grant could pull, using the full, legitimate force of the law. It boxed him in. It limited his movements. It turned his quest for the light into a furtive skulk in the shadows.

He began to walk, not hurrying, keeping his head up. The war had a face. And now, that face had the police on speed-dial. Donnie had turned the past into a weapon. Grant had just turned the present into a crime scene.

He pulled his collar up, not against the rain, but against the new, institutional chill in the air. The next move wasn’t Grant’s anymore. It was his. And he had to make it from the wrong side of a line that had just been drawn in blood and official procedure. The quiet house’s trembling reckoning was over. Now the reckoning would be loud, public, and have his picture attached.

# Chapter 18

## **CHAPTER 18**

The old swimming baths on Maitland Street were a carcass of civic pride. The red sandstone was blackened at the joints, the grand, arched windows boarded with plywood that had long since given up being wood and had become a kind of damp, fibrous skin. Donnie stood in the lee of the entrance, where the words ‘Wash-Hoose and Public Baths’ were still legible in the stone, worn smooth by a century of grimy fingers and Glaswegian rain. The place smelled of pigeon shit and wet masonry, a cold, deep smell that came from the gut of the building.

Archie’s Vauxhall Astra, a car the colour of a forgotten bruise, pulled in off the street with a soft crunch of gravel on bald tyres. Donnie got in. The interior held the familiar fug of Old Spice, stale tobacco, and the faint, sweet tang of engine oil. Archie didn’t look at him. He put the car in gear and they rolled away, the empty baths shrinking in the wing mirror like a bad memory.

“You saw the news?” Archie’s voice was a low rumble, tuned to the idle of the engine.

“I got the highlights.”

“It’s worse than highlights. It’s a feature presentation.” Archie took a left, heading north, away from the centre. “They’ve named her. Moira Kennedy, forty-two. They’re calling it a ‘tragic incident’ under investigation. But the subtext is screaming. Neighbour heard a man’s voice raised. Neighbour saw a man leaving, distressed. Your description, Donnie. Not detailed, but enough. ‘Tall, gaunt, dark jacket.’ They’ve put a generic sketch on the evening bulletin. It looks like every second man in the city, and exactly like you.”

Donnie watched the streets slide by. A woman wrestled a buggy onto a bus. Two binmen shared a cigarette, steam rising from their high-vis jackets in the cold air. The local universal. Life, in all its mundane, relentless detail, while his own life contracted to a single, poisonous point.

“They’ve been to the *Clansman*,” Archie continued. “Asking about you. Showing the sketch. Big Tam gave them nothing but a blank stare and a wiped glass, but they’ll be back. They’ve been to your last known. The flat in Dennistoun. The landlord told them you’d done a moonlight, months back. That just makes you look flightier. More guilty.”

“Grant’s tidying the edges,” Donnie said. His voice sounded calm in the close space of the car. It felt like someone else’s voice. “Making the picture neat. A troubled woman. A violent, unstable acquaintance from her past. A forced entry, maybe. A struggle. Then, her guilt, or fear, overwhelms her. She does the deed. I vanish. Case closes with a bow on it.”

“And you’re left running, or in a cell. Either way, you’re silenced.” Archie’s knuckles were white on the wheel. “He’s good. I’ll give him that. He’s not just a thug with a calculator. He’s a director.”

“Where are we going?”

“Somewhere you can be a ghost for a minute. While we think.”

They drove into Sighthill, the high-rise blocks standing like tombstones in the misty afternoon light. Archie pulled into the shadowed undercroft of one, a concrete cavern that smelled of urine and fried food. He killed the engine. The silence that followed was thick, broken only by the distant whine of a lift and the drip of water from a leaking pipe.

“You had a victory,” Archie said, not looking at him. “You got the ledger. You had him sweating. I saw it. We both did. It felt like a turn. A false one, as it happens.”

Donnie said nothing. The memory of the ledger in his hands, the names, the numbers—it had felt solid. A key. Now, it felt like a prop in a play where the stage had just collapsed beneath him.

“The polis,” Archie said. “They’ll find you. It’s not a matter of if, but when. Grant’s given them a road map. You need to give them a reason to look a different way.”

“I have the ledger. That’s a reason.”

“Is it?” Archie finally turned, his face grave. “You show that to a detective, even a clean one, and what do you have? A stolen book of numbers. No provenance. From a man who’s just had an associate commit suicide under suspicious circumstances. It looks like a desperate smear. A distraction. It ties you *deeper* to her, to him. It makes you look obsessed, unhinged. You’d be handing Grant the rope and pointing to the beam.”

The truth of it landed in Donnie’s gut, cold and heavy. Archie was right. The ledger was a weapon only in the shadows. In the light of a police interview room, under the glare of procedure, it was tainted evidence. It was motive.

“So I run.”

“You run, you’re cooked. They’ll put a warrant out. You’ll be a face in every paper, on every screen. Grant will have his contacts keep the story warm. You’ll never stop.”

The drip from the pipe marked time. *Tick. Tick. Tick.* A countdown in the damp dark.

“There’s another way,” Archie said, his voice dropping even lower. “You give them a different man.”

Donnie looked at him. Archie’s eyes were lost in the shadows of his sockets, but a hard gleam was in them.

“You can’t be serious.”

“I’m dead serious. Grant made a man vanish into a crime scene. We make a man vanish from one.” Archie leaned in. “The description is vague. Tall, gaunt, dark jacket. That’s half of Glasgow. We find one of Grant’s other boys. Someone who fits. Someone with a reason to have been there. We point the polis at him. We give them a whisper. A nudge. We let their machinery do the work. It turns the heat off you, and onto Grant’s own operation. It’s a grenade rolled back into his lap.”

It was brutal. It was cynical. It was a mirror of Grant’s own move, reflecting the filth back at him. Donnie felt a revulsion, deep and instinctive. It was a step into a moral undercroft darker than the one they sat in.

“And become what? Him?”

“You become alive,” Archie said, no apology in his tone. “You become free to use that ledger properly. To find the light, like you said. You can’t do that from a prison cell, or from a ditch. This is the game now. He changed the rules. You either walk off the pitch, or you play his way, better.”

The local universal pressed in. The hum of the city beyond the concrete, a world of small, honest struggles. A man providing for his family. A woman getting home safe. A quiet life. That door was closing for him, if it wasn’t already shut. The only doors left were marked with blood and lies.

“Who?” Donnie asked, the word tasting of ash.

Archie sat back. “There’s a lad. Works the collections for Grant’s bookmaking arm. A nasty piece of work. Name’s Stevie Laird. He’s got a temper. He’s been known to lean on women who are behind on their husband’s tabs. He fits the sketch. And he was in the area last night. I know because I was watching Grant’s people after you left the yard. Laird was collecting from a snooker hall on Duke Street. He’d have passed right by Moira’s street.”

“You have proof?”

“I have a time-stamped photo of his car on Duke Street. From my dashcam. It’s not proof he was at her door. But it’s a seed. We plant it. We water it with an anonymous tip. The polis will do the rest. They’ll pull him in. They’ll lean on him. He’s got a record. Violence. He’ll crack, or he’ll look guilty trying not to. Either way, the focus shifts.”

It was elegant in its ugliness. Donnie saw the mechanics of it. The police, hungry for a clear narrative, would clutch at a viable suspect. Grant would be forced to either sacrifice Laird or fight to protect him, exposing another strand of his web. The pressure would lift from Donnie. A false victory, traded for a false suspect.

He thought of Moira Kennedy. Her trembling hands. The fear in her eyes that was older than Grant. He was going to use her death, not just as a spur, but as a tool. He would be draping her memory over another man, a scapegoat, for his own survival. The reckoning wasn’t just loud now. It was corrupt.

“No,” Donnie said.

Archie stared. “What?”

“No. We don’t do that.”

“Donnie, for Christ’s sake—”

“We don’t become him,” Donnie said, and the conviction in his own voice surprised him. It wasn’t righteousness. It was a colder, harder thing. A line, drawn in the muck of his own soul. “We don’t feed people to the machine. Even bastards like Laird. That’s his move. That’s the whole sickness of it. People are tools. Things to be used, broken, discarded. I won’t.”

“Then what’s your play?” Archie’s voice was tight with frustration. “You walk into the station? You hand them the book and say ‘a wee word about Mr. Grant’? They’ll eat you alive.”

“I go to the source,” Donnie said. The idea was forming, jagged and dangerous, as he spoke. “The ledger. It’s a list of people he’s paying, or who are paying him. Cops. Council. Maybe a journalist or two. But it’s just numbers. Codes. We need a key. We need someone on the inside who can read it, who has a reason to want it read.”

Archie was silent for a long moment. The drip of the pipe was the only sound. “You’re talking about turning one of his own.”

“I’m talking about finding the weak link. The one who’s afraid. The one Grant is squeezing. Like he squeezed Moira.” Donnie looked at the names in his mind, the columns of figures. “He didn’t get this big, this secure, without making enemies even in his own bed. We find that enemy. We offer them the ledger. Not as a weapon for us. As a shield for them.”

“It’s a hell of a risk. You approach the wrong one, they’ll hand you to Grant for a pat on the head.”

“It’s the only move that doesn’t make us him.” Donnie looked out at the stained concrete wall. “Moira’s death… it can’t just be a pawn move. It has to mean something. It has to be the thing that breaks the game, not the thing that pulls us into it.”

Archie sighed, a long, weary exhalation. He rubbed a big hand over his face. “You’re a principled man, Donnie McCallum. In another life, it might have been a virtue. In this one, it’s a luxury you can’t afford.”

“It’s the only thing I can afford,” Donnie said. “Everything else is already spent.”

Archie nodded, slowly, reluctantly. “Alright. No scapegoat. So we need a name. Someone on that list who’s more afraid of Grant than they are of the law. How do we find them?”

“We look for the anomaly,” Donnie said. “The payment that’s too small. Or too big. The regular one that stopped. The pattern that broke.” He took the ledger from his inside pocket. In the gloom of the car, it was just a dark rectangle. “We need light.”

Archie turned on the interior light. The sudden, weak yellow glow made the cavern outside seem blacker. Donnie opened the ledger. The columns of figures, the initials, the dates. He had pored over them before looking for the big picture. Now he was looking for a crack.

He found it on a page near the middle. A sequence of payments, marked ‘SC’, every month for three years. Always the same amount. Then, six months ago, they doubled. Then, three months ago, they stopped entirely. Next to the last entry, a tiny, pencilled question mark. Then, a new code began: ‘M.K.’. Moira Kennedy. The same amount as the original ‘SC’ payments had been.

“Someone got greedy,” Donnie murmured, tracing the line with his finger. “SC asked for more. Grant gave it, for a while. Then he cut them off. Replaced them with a cheaper, more vulnerable option. Moira.”

“SC,” Archie repeated. “Could be anyone.”

“But they’re connected to Moira. Same function. Same slot in his machine. He upgraded.” Donnie’s mind raced. “SC was the original canary. They saw the replacement. They know what happens when you outlive your usefulness to Grant. They’ll be terrified. Waiting for the knock.”

“So we find SC before Grant decides they’re a loose end that needs tying.” Archie’s eyes met Donnie’s in the dim light. “It’s a race.”

“It’s the only race left,” Donnie said.

He closed the ledger. The interior light felt like a beacon in the vast, dark undercroft. He clicked it off. They sat in the renewed darkness, the plan hanging between them, fragile and sharp as an icicle.

“We need to move,” Archie said, starting the car. The engine coughed, then roared to life, the sound magnified by the concrete walls. “You can’t stay in the city. Not with your face about to be on the telly.”

“I need to be close. To find SC.”

“You’ll be close. But not here.” Archie reversed out, the headlights sweeping across graffiti-strewn walls. “I know a place. A widow in Bishopbriggs. Her husband owed me a favour. A big one. She’ll give you a room. No questions. You’ll be a ghost.”

They emerged onto the street. The afternoon was fading into a damp, purple dusk. The streetlights began to buzz on, their orange haloes smeared in the gathering mist. Donnie watched the city pass, a tableau of ordinary endings: shops pulling down shutters, folk queueing for buses, the nightly retreat behind closed doors. His own door was gone. He was in the space between.

Archie drove in silence, taking back routes, his eyes constantly checking the mirrors. The paranoia was a living thing in the car now. Every set of headlights behind them was a potential tail. Every pedestrian on a phone was a lookout.

After forty minutes, they pulled up a quiet, tree-lined street in Bishopbriggs, the houses neat semis with well-tended gardens. It was a world away from the Gallowgate, from Sighthill. A world of quiet compliance. Archie stopped three houses down from a corner property with a dark blue door.

“That’s it. Number 42. Agnes Tulloch. Tell her Archie sent you. Tell her you’re the friend in need. She’ll understand.”

Donnie made to get out.

“Donnie.” Archie’s hand on his arm was heavy. “You’re betting everything on finding a scared person and trusting them. That’s a hell of a wager.”

“It’s the only one on the table,” Donnie said. He got out, the cold air sharp after the fug of the car. He pulled his collar up, not against the rain, but against the watching windows, the quiet judgement of a settled street.

He walked to the dark blue door and rang the bell. After a moment, a light came on in the hall. The door opened a crack, a chain still on. An elderly woman’s face, wary, intelligent, appeared in the gap.

“Yes?”

“Agnes Tulloch? Archie sent me. I’m the friend in need.”

Her eyes, a pale, watery blue, scanned him. They took in the gauntness, the dark jacket, the tension in his shoulders. She saw it all. For a long moment, she said nothing. Then, with a soft *snick*, she undid the chain and opened the door wider.

“You’d better come in,” she said. Her voice was dry, like rustling paper. “And wipe your feet. I’ve just hoovered.”

Donnie stepped over the threshold into a hallway that smelled of furniture polish and boiled vegetables. It was the smell of lonely, meticulous order. Agnes closed the door behind him, locking it, shooting the bolt. The sound was final. He was in, and the world was out.

She led him to a small, tidy sitting room. A gas fire hissed behind a faux-coal effect. A television was on mute, showing the evening news. Donnie’s own face, a years-old photo from a driver’s licence, was not yet on the screen. But a police artist’s sketch, generic and hauntingly familiar, was. The caption read: ‘MAN SOUGHT IN CONNECTION’.

Agnes followed his gaze. She picked up the remote and turned the television off. The room was silent but for the hiss of the fire.

“You’ll be wanting the back room,” she said, as if discussing a B&B booking. “It’s upstairs. Bathroom’s at the end of the hall. I do breakfast at seven. I’ll leave it on a tray outside your door. You don’t come down. Not while it’s light. Understood?”

Donnie nodded. “Thank you.”

“Don’t thank me. Thank my Frank, God rest him.” She looked at him again, that same assessing stare. “Archie’s never asked for this before. So you’re either very good, or in very deep trouble.”

“The latter, I think.”

“Aye,” she said, a flicker of something like pity in her eyes. “I can see that. The room’s at the top. Don’t use the main light. The curtain’s thick. There’s a reading lamp.”

She turned and walked towards the kitchen, her slippers whispering on the linoleum. Donnie climbed the stairs. They creaked under his weight, a chorus of complaint. The back room was small, cold, and clean. A single bed, a wardrobe, a small desk. The curtain was, as promised, a thick, dark fabric. He turned on the reading lamp, a pool of weak light on the faded counterpane.

He sat on the bed, the ledger heavy in his hands. He opened it to the page with ‘SC’. In the quiet, the fear began to seep in, cold and insidious. The fear of the hunted. The fear of the next knock not being Agnes with a tray, but a boot on the blue door downstairs. The fear that his principle was just a slower form of suicide.

He took out his phone. He had one bar of signal. He typed a text to Archie, the phone’s glow the only light on his face.

*‘Need everything on SC. Any link to Moira K. Jobs, family, old addresses. Fast.’*

He sent it. The whoosh of the sent message sounded obscenely loud in the silent house.

He lay back on the bed, staring at the ceiling where the light from the streetlamp outside bled around the edges of the thick curtain, casting a faint, orange line. He was in a safe house, but he had never felt more exposed. The victory of the ledger was ash. The path ahead was a tightrope over a void, and he had just refused the only net.

He thought of Grant. Not as a monster, but as a man in a warm office, perhaps pouring a drink, watching the news. Satisfied. He had taken Donnie’s move and had turned it into a cage. A cage of suspicion, of procedure, of public scrutiny. Donnie’s world had collapsed not with a bang, but with a police bulletin and a neighbour’s statement. The false victory of chapters past was well and truly shattered.

Now, he had to build something from the wreckage with nothing but a book of numbers and a name. SC. A ghost, just like him. One ghost hunting another in the dark, while the man who owned the darkness waited for them both to stumble.

The orange line on the ceiling seemed to pulse, like a faint, dying heartbeat. The local universal, outside this room, was settling in for the night. Meals were eaten. Dishes washed. Laughter track comedies played on televisions. And in a quiet house with a dark blue door, a man held a ledger and prayed that the fear in another human soul was greater than the fear in his own.

The hook for the next move was not action. It was identification. He had to give the ghost a face before his own face was on every screen in the city, and the knock finally came. Not from Grant’s men, but from the law. And once that door opened, the little light he had would be snuffed out for good.

# Chapter 19

## **CHAPTER 19**

The orange line on the ceiling was a lie. It promised a dawn that was hours away, a world beyond the dark blue door that was still turning. Donnie knew better. The world had stopped. It had stopped the moment the news bulletin had crackled through the radio in the stolen car, his own name hanging in the static like a bad smell. The local universal—the dinners, the dishwater, the canned laughter—was a fiction played out behind other curtains. His reality was this room, the ledger’s cold weight on his chest, and the silence that wasn’t silence at all but a high, thin ringing in his ears.

He didn’t sleep. Sleep was a surrender he couldn’t afford. He watched the line, tracking its slow fade as the streetlamp gave up and died before the true morning came. The room sank into a grainy, monochrome dark. He heard the first gulls, their cries raw and hungry over the rooftops. A bin lorry groaned its way along the next street, the crash of glass a punctuation mark in the emptiness.

His phone, face-down on the floor, vibrated.

It wasn’t Archie. Archie would call. This was a text. A single, solid buzz that felt like a physical blow in the quiet.

He left it for a full minute, his eyes on the grey square of the window. Let the sender sweat. Let them wonder if the message had found a dead man. Finally, he reached down, his fingers stiff. The screen’s light was a violence in the dark.

*Unknown Sender.*

*‘You’re looking for a face. You have a book. I have a name. The Laurieston. Booth at the back. 11am. Come alone. Tell no one. Not even the old spice.’*

Donnie read it three times. The words didn’t change. The Laurieston. A pub. Not a quiet one. A city centre place, all wood and glass, busy with shoppers and day-drinkers. A public place. A smart move. Safer for a ghost than a deserted car park or a lock-up.

SC. It had to be. The ghost had felt the ripple. Donnie’s desperate, digital shout into the void had been heard. The ledger was a magnet, and it had pulled a piece of iron from the shadows.

He deleted the message. The action was automatic, sterile. He got up from the bed, his body protesting, every muscle knotted from hours of inert tension. In the bathroom, he splashed tepid water on his face and looked at the man in the mirror. The face that was supposed to be on every screen. Stubble greyed the pallor of his cheeks. His eyes were two stones sunk in clay. He looked like what he was: a fugitive holding a secret too hot to handle.

He had six hours. He dressed in the clothes from the holdall: dark jeans, a plain black t-shirt, a grey hooded jacket that was too thin for the lingering damp. He checked the lock on the back door, the sightlines from the front window. The street was waking up. A woman in a nurse’s uniform hurried past, head down. An old man walked a terrier that strained at the lead. Normalcy, performed.

At half-eight, Archie called.

“Nothin’,” Archie said, the word a gravelly sigh down the line. “Moira K. is a closed book. Birth certificate, death certificate, and a thirty-year gap in between with not so much as a library fine. She was a ghost before she was a corpse. SC… initials could be anythin’. I’m diggin’, but it’s like spoonin’ smoke.”

“Keep at it,” Donnie said, his voice flat. He watched the old man and the terrier turn the corner. “Anything from your pals in blue?”

“Radio silence. Too quiet. Grant’s got them on a leash. The bulletin was the bait. Now he’s waitin’ for a bite. You’re the fish, Donnie. Don’t twitch.”

“I’m not twitching.”

He could hear Archie breathing, could picture him in his own kitchen, the big man wedged in the doorway, the cordless phone pressed to his ear. “You’ve got a plan,” Archie said. It wasn’t a question this time either.

“I’m following a thread.”

“A thread? Christ, Donnie, the whole jumper’s unravelled. Where?”

“Can’t say.”

A long pause. The silence between them was a third presence on the line, heavy with everything unsaid. “Right,” Archie said finally, the word clipped. “You’re cuttin’ me out.”

“I’m keeping you clean.”

“Clean?” Archie gave a short, hard laugh. “I stopped bein’ clean the day I took your first call. I’m in the muck same as you. Just further from the centre.”

“This is different, Archie. This is a meet.”

He heard the sharp intake of breath. “Who with?”

“The thread.”

“Donnie, for fuck’s sake—”

“If you don’t hear from me by midnight,” Donnie said, talking over him, his eyes on the empty street, “the ledger’s under the third flagstone from the back wall in the yard of the safe house. You know what to do with it.”

“I’m not your bloody executor!”

“You’re my friend,” Donnie said, and the word felt strange in his mouth, a relic from a different life. “That’s worse. Do it. And don’t follow me.”

He ended the call before Archie could reply. He switched the phone off, removed the battery. For a moment, he held the separate pieces in his palm. A dead thing. He was cutting the last tether. It felt less like bravery and more like stepping off a kerb without looking.

*

The Laurieston stood on a corner, its sandstone façade streaked with decades of exhaust fumes. It was an old man of a pub, stubborn amongst the glass and steel. Donnie approached from the south, his hood up, his hands in his pockets. He moved with the crowd, a piece of driftwood in the current of shoppers and workers. He didn’t look at the pub directly. He let his peripheral vision take it in.

The front windows were tall, giving a clear view of the long, polished bar. It was busy but not heaving. Lunchtime trade. Office workers with jackets on the backs of their chairs, couples sharing a plate of chips, a few solitary older men nursing pints and newspapers. He circled the block, coming up the side street, checking the alley that ran behind. No vans. No loitering men with earpieces. Nothing that screamed Grant.

He entered at five past eleven. The smell hit him first: beer, polish, frying oil, and the faint, sweet tang of old tobacco ingrained in the wood. Sound washed over him—the clatter of cutlery, the low hum of a dozen conversations, a football highlights reel playing silently on a screen above the gantry. He stood just inside the door, letting his eyes adjust to the gloom, feeling the weight of the space.

Booth at the back.

There were three. One occupied by a young family. One empty. And in the last, tucked into the corner where the light from the window didn’t quite reach, a figure sat facing the room.

Donnie walked towards it. He didn’t hurry. He passed the bar, felt the barman’s glance skate over him and away. He was nobody. Just another man meeting someone for a pint.

The figure in the booth was a woman. She was in her late forties, maybe early fifties. Her hair was a sensible, short-cut brown, streaked with grey. She wore a navy waterproof jacket over a cream roll-neck jumper. A half-finished glass of white wine sat on the table in front of her, next to a phone. She was reading a paperback novel, her fingers steady on the spine. She didn’t look up as Donnie slid into the seat opposite.

He said nothing. He watched her. She turned a page. Her nails were short, clean, unvarnished. After a full minute, she marked her place with a ticket stub and closed the book. She looked at him. Her face was unremarkable, the kind of face you’d forget five minutes after seeing it. Pleasant. Tired. But her eyes were a pale, washed-out blue, and they held his without a flicker. They were eyes that had seen ledgers before.

“You’re Donnie McCallum,” she said. Her voice was low, educated, with the faintest trace of the west coast buried under something more neutral.

“And you’re SC.”

She gave a small, almost imperceptible shake of her head. “SC was the account. The shell. My name is Sarah Cowie.”

It was a real name. She’d given him a real name. The risk of it hung between them. It was either a gesture of catastrophic trust or a very clever trap.

“You worked for Grant,” Donnie said.

“I *managed* for Grant,” she corrected, her tone precise. “For eleven years. I was his accountant. His bookkeeper. His cleaner.” She took a sip of her wine. Her hand was perfectly steady. “Moira Kincaid was my aunt. My mother’s sister. She had no one else. When she died, I used her identity. A dead woman to hide a living one. It’s cleaner than inventing someone from scratch. Fewer digital footprints.”

“Why run?”

She looked at him as if the question was naive. “You’re holding the ‘why’ in your bag, Mr. McCallum. I kept the books. I knew the real numbers. Not the ones filed with Companies House, not the ones the investors saw. The real ones. The ones that flowed to council officials, to planning officers, to certain individuals in the police. The ones that paid for the accidents that weren’t accidents, the opposition that quietly disappeared.” She leaned forward, just an inch. “A ledger like that isn’t a retirement fund. It’s a death warrant. I knew it. So when I sensed a shift… a new coldness… I took my copy and I vanished. I thought I’d done it neatly. I left no trail. Only Grant knew I existed, and he couldn’t report me missing without raising questions he couldn’t answer.”

“But he found Moira,” Donnie said.

“He found a death certificate,” she whispered. The first crack in her composure. A faint tremor in the words. “He must have been looking for years. Quietly. Using resources I didn’t know he had. He found her, and he knew it was my bolt-hole. My sanctuary. He had her killed. Not to find me. To send me a message. To tell me he was still looking. That nowhere was safe.”

“A message you got.”

“I got it.” She looked down at her wine glass. “I’ve been moving every seventy-two hours since. Sleeping with the lights on. Jumping at shadows. It’s no way to live. It’s not living at all.” Her pale eyes found his again. “Then I hear a name on the news. Donnie McCallum. A man Grant wants very badly. And I hear whispers, from the few contacts I have left who aren’t dead or bought, that this man might have something. A book. My book.”

“So you reached out.”

“I’m reaching out,” she said. “You have the evidence. I have the context. The key to the code. You have names and numbers. I can tell you what each number bought, who each name truly is. Without me, it’s just a list. With me, it’s a narrative. A story that could bring down a kingdom.”

Donnie studied her. The fear was there, deep down, a cold current under the calm surface. But so was the calculation. This was a trade. Her life for her knowledge.

“Grant’s framed me,” Donnie said. “For murder. The police will be on me soon. I’m a dead man walking.”

“We both are,” Sarah Cowie said. “That’s why we have to move now. While he thinks you’re running scared and I’m running silent. He’ll be consolidating his power, leaning on his contacts, making sure his version of events is the only one that sticks. We have a window. A small one.”

“What’s your play?”

“The media,” she said, without hesitation. “Not the local rags. Not the Scottish press. They’re all in someone’s pocket. National. A broadsheet with a reputation for investigative work. We give them the ledger, and I give them the testimony. We give them the whole, rotten story. We make it too big, too public, for Grant to bury. He can buy a detective. He can’t buy the front page of *The Chronicle* and the scrutiny that comes with it.”

It was a bold plan. Reckless. It felt like throwing a match into a petrol tank and hoping you were far enough away when it blew.

“They’d need to verify it. They’d need to meet you.”

“I know,” she said. “I’m prepared for that. I have a place. A different one. Safer than this. We can go there now. We can start. We don’t have another day to waste.”

Donnie felt the tightrope beneath him vibrate. This was the move. The identification was made. The ghost had a face, a name, and a plan. It was more than he’d had an hour ago. It was a path, however dangerous.

He gave a single, slow nod. “Alright.”

She didn’t smile in relief. She simply nodded back, a businesslike acknowledgement. She pulled a twenty-pound note from her pocket and placed it under her wine glass. “Leave first. Turn left. Walk to the Clyde. Wait on the south side of the pedestrian bridge, the one by the science centre. I’ll find you in ten minutes. If I’m not there in fifteen, run.”

She picked up her book and stood. For a moment, she was just a middle-aged woman leaving a pub after a quiet drink. Then she was gone, melting into the light at the front door.

Donnie waited a full two minutes, his heart a dull hammer against his ribs. He replayed every word, every micro-expression. It felt real. The fear was real. The details were too specific, too mundane, to be a fabrication. Moira’s death had been the pebble that started this avalanche.

He stood, shouldered his bag with the ledger, and walked out. The cold air felt sharp, clean after the pub’s warmth. He turned left, as instructed, and began to walk towards the river.

He was three blocks away, the broad expanse of the Clyde coming into view, the titanium curl of the science centre glinting under the flat white sky, when he saw the first one.

A man in a black puffa jacket, leaning against a lamppost, talking into his phone. He didn’t look at Donnie. But he’d been outside the Laurieston earlier, tying a shoelace.

Donnie didn’t break stride. He kept walking, his pace even. At the next corner, he glanced in a shop window. Reflected in the glass, another man, younger, in a baseball cap, was window-shopping fifty yards back.

They were good. They weren’t police. Police would have closed in by now, with shouts and badges. These were watchers. Tails. Grant’s men.

Sarah Cowie had been followed. Or she had led them here.

The pedestrian bridge was ahead, its white cables stark against the grey water. The hook was not identification anymore. It was betrayal. He had given the ghost a face, and the face had led him into a field of ghosts, all of them working for the man who owned the dark.

He reached the bridge and crossed to the south side, as agreed. He stopped, leaning on the railing, looking down at the sluggish, brown water. He counted in his head. The ten minutes passed. At twelve minutes, he saw Sarah Cowie appear at the far end of the bridge. She walked towards him, alone.

But Donnie wasn’t looking at her. He was looking past her, at the two men now standing at the bridge’s northern entrance, blocking the way back. And at the black van that had just pulled up silently on the south-side road behind him, its engine still running.

The trap wasn’t at the meeting. The trap was after. They’d let the thread connect, let the desperate fugitive find his ally, and now they would reel them both in together.

Sarah reached him. Her calm was gone. Her face was a mask of pure panic. “They’re here,” she breathed. “I didn’t know, I swear to God I didn’t know.”

Donnie believed her. The fear in her eyes was the same fear that had been pulsing in his own veins for days. It was the fear of the net finally closing.

He looked at the water. He looked at the van, its side door now sliding open. He looked at Sarah Cowie, the key to the ledger, the only other soul who knew the full truth, standing beside him on the bridge.

The hook for the next move was not a choice. It was a calculation. Two ghosts, one ledger, and the cold, deep water of the Clyde.

# Chapter 20

## **CHAPTER 20**

The water of the Clyde was the colour of cold tea, flecked with a grey scum of rain and city grime. It didn’t flow so much as it oozed, a thick, indifferent current carrying the secrets of the city out to sea. Donnie’s eyes were on it, but his mind was a map. The bridge was a cage of white steel. North entrance: two men, hands in pockets, casual as Sunday strollers. South side: the black van, diesel idle a low growl beneath the drum of rain on the road. The side door was open now, a dark rectangle. He couldn’t see how many were inside. He didn’t need to.

Sarah Cowie’s breath hitched beside him, a small, trapped sound. “Oh, Christ. Oh, Christ, Donnie.”

He didn’t look at her. He kept his gaze on the water, his posture loose against the railing, a man pausing to watch the river. A man with time. “The ledger,” he said, his voice low, flat. “Where is it?”

“I don’t have it *on* me,” she whispered, frantic. “It’s safe. A deposit box. Key’s in my flat.”

A deposit box. It was a professional’s move. It was also a dead end if she was in a van. The key in her flat was as good as at the bottom of the river. The two men at the north end began to walk, slow and deliberate, onto the bridge. Their footsteps were muffled by the wet, but the vibration travelled up through the steel into Donnie’s palms where they rested on the cold railing.

“The key,” he said. “Where in the flat?”

“Biscuit tin. Flour shelf.” Her words were tumbling out. “Top cupboard. Please, you have to believe me, I didn’t lead them here.”

“Doesn’t matter now.” The men were thirty yards away. The van’s engine revved, just once, a prompt. They weren’t going to shoot. Not here, in the open, on a bridge in the middle of the afternoon. This was a snatch. Quiet, efficient. The van would pull up, they’d be bundled in, and the Clyde would see nothing but the usual rain.

He believed her about the betrayal. The panic on her face was not an act. It was the raw, animal terror of a creature that had felt safe in its burrow right up until the spade bit into the earth above it. She was a ghost, just like him. And Grant’s men were the exorcists.

The calculation was simple, brutal. Two of them. One ledger. The men would take her. They would make her talk. She would break, because everyone breaks, and she would give them the location. The ledger would be gone, and Sarah Cowie would be a body in a quarry, or a weight in the loch. Donnie, if they took him too, would join her. If he ran, he was a man with nothing, a story with no proof, a target with a price that would only get higher.

The water was ten feet below. It was deep, and it was cold enough to stop a heart in minutes.

The two men were twenty yards away. One of them, the older one with a salt-and-pepper beard, gave a slight, almost apologetic nod.

Donnie moved.

He didn’t shove Sarah. He turned into her, his body blocking the view from the north for a second, his mouth at her ear. “When you hit, swim for the south bank. Under the bridge. Go.”

Her eyes widened, incomprehension turning to horror. He grabbed the strap of her leather shoulder bag, yanked it hard, and spun her towards the railing. It was less a push than a direction of her own momentum. She cried out, a short, sharp gasp lost in the wind, and went over the side. There was a slap, not a splash, as she hit the water flat.

The two men broke into a run.

Donnie didn’t watch her. He was already moving south, towards the van, but not directly. He went up and over the railing in one fluid motion, a memory of a thousand childhood fences, and dropped onto the narrow service ledge that ran along the outside of the bridge parapet. It was a foot wide, slick with rain and moss. The river churned below, a brown yawn.

The van door slammed and two more men spilled out, big, blocky shapes in dark jackets. They fanned out to cut him off along the ledge.

He was trapped between the two from the north and the two from the south, pinned against the outside of his own cage. The calculation shifted. The water was now the only exit that wasn’t a fist or a van.

Then the older man with the beard, now five yards away on the bridge walkway, spoke. His voice was calm, a teacher’s voice. “Don’t be daft, son. It’s over. Come in out of the rain.”

Donnie looked past him, downriver. He saw a flash of dark fabric, an arm, then nothing. Sarah was under, or she was moving. He hoped to God she could swim.

“Grant just wants a chat,” the man said, taking a careful step closer. He had his hands open, non-threatening. A professional. “Nobody needs to get hurt. The lassie’s in the water. Let us get her out. It’s freezing.”

It was a good line. Compassionate. Practical. It was also a lie so transparent it was almost insulting. They’d fish her out and wring the truth from her, then toss her back.

Donnie inched along the ledge, his back to the cold, riveted steel of the parapet. The two from the van were closing in from the other side, steady as tide. He had ten feet of ledge left before he met them.

He looked at the bearded man. “Tell Grant I’ll chat. After I’ve read the paper.”

Then he dropped.

It wasn’t a dive. It was a controlled fall, knees bent, arms tight to his sides. He hit the water like a stone, and the cold was a physical blow. It drove the air from his lungs in a silent, shocked burst. It wasn’t just cold; it was a deep, penetrating *absence* of heat, a solid force that clamped around his chest and squeezed. The world vanished into a roaring, brown silence.

He fought the instinct to thrash, to gasp. He let the momentum of the fall carry him down, then kicked, not for the surface, but south, towards the bank. The current tugged at him, lazy but insistent. His clothes were lead weights, his shoes anchors. His vision was a blur of particulate gloom. He saw nothing but shifting shadows and a faint, greenish light from the world above.

His lungs began to burn. The cold was in his bones now, a dull ache spreading from his core. He angled upwards, one arm stroking, the other pressed against the stitch of agony in his side. He broke the surface with a ragged, choked inhale that was half river water.

He was thirty yards downstream of the bridge. He twisted in the water, treading heavily. The black van was still there, but men were running along the south bank towards him. On the bridge, the bearded man was at the railing, pointing. No sign of Sarah.

Donnie went under again, kicking for the shadow of the south bank. The river wall was slick, sheer stone. He found a rusted iron ladder, half-submerged, and hauled himself onto it, his muscles screaming, his fingers numb and clumsy. He dragged his body out of the suck of the water and collapsed onto a narrow, trash-strewn strip of concrete between the wall and a chain-link fence.

He lay there for a count of three, water pouring from him, his body shuddering with a violence that felt like it would shake his teeth loose. Then he forced himself up. He had to move. They would be on the bank in seconds.

He scrambled along the wall, away from the ladder. A hundred yards along, the fence had been peeled back. He slipped through the gap, into a derelict yard behind a boarded-up warehouse. Pallets were stacked like rotten teeth. He moved through them, his wet clothes dragging, his breath a raw scrape in his throat.

He didn’t stop for two miles. He moved through a Glasgow that felt like a different city, a backstage maze of service lanes, locked gates, and railway arches. The rain kept falling, the greasy smear now a blessing, keeping heads down, windows closed. He was a dripping phantom in the urban cracks, his warmth leaching away with every step. He finally ducked into the covered entrance of a disused public toilet, a Victorian relic of green copper and stinking damp. He slumped against the tiled wall, sliding down to the filthy floor, and gave in to the shivers.

The hook was gone. Sarah Cowie was in the river or in a van. The ledger was in a deposit box, the key in a biscuit tin on a flour shelf. He was a man of ice and failure, sitting in a piss-stained tomb.

He had to get warm. He had to get dry. And he had to get into a dead woman’s flat.

***

The tenement in Partick was a red-sandstone fortress, four storeys of respectable decay. Sarah Cowie’s flat was on the top floor, a single flight above where the city’s money had once stopped and the struggle began. Donnie watched it from the mouth of a close across the street, a shadow in deeper shadow. He’d stolen a dry jacket from a charity donation bin behind a church, a coarse, navy thing that smelled of mothballs and regret. It was too thin, but it was a barrier against the wind. His own clothes were a sodden bundle in a carrier bag at his feet.

The street was quiet. A few lights glowed behind drawn curtains. No black vans. No men with patient eyes. They would come, though. If they had Sarah, they would be coming soon. If they didn’t have her, they would still come, to tear the place apart for the key.

He had to be first.

He crossed the street, not hurrying, a man coming home late. The close mouth was dark, the timer switch for the light long broken. He took the stairs slowly, his wet shoes squelching faintly on the stone. The sound seemed monstrously loud in the hollow silence. On the third landing, a dog barked once, behind a door, and was hushed.

Her door was at the end of the landing. A plain, dark wood door with two locks. He listened, ear to the cold paint. Nothing. He took out the set of picks Archie had given him a lifetime ago, in a different world. His fingers were still stiff, clumsy with cold. The first lock, a simple Yale, yielded after a minute of fumbling. The second, a five-lever deadbolt, was harder. He worked by touch in the gloom, the rain a distant patter on the skylight above. The final pin clicked over. He turned the heavy handle and pushed the door open an inch.

The smell hit him first. Not decay, but absence. The stale, closed-up smell of a life paused. He slipped inside, closed the door behind him, and stood in the dark, listening to the silence of the flat. It was a listening silence. He could feel the ghost of her in it, the careful, precise ghost who kept a ledger and used deposit boxes.

He didn’t turn on a light. He used the faint grey glow from the streetlamp outside the window to navigate. The living room was neat, obsessively so. Books arranged by height on the shelves. A single armchair by a gas fire. A small desk, bare except for a anglepoise lamp and a blotter. No photographs. No personal touches. It was the safehouse of a mind, not the home of a heart.

He went to the kitchen. It was small, clinical. He opened the top cupboard beside the sink. Tins. Soup, beans, tomatoes. He moved them aside. At the back, a old blue biscuit tin, a picture of a Highland cow on the lid. He lifted it down. It was light.

He opened it. Inside, on a bed of faded tissue paper, lay a single, small, silver key. Number 417. There was no bank name, no logo. Just the number. He pocketed it. He searched the rest of the tin, the cupboard, the kitchen. Nothing else. No copy of the ledger. No notes. She had been careful.

He moved through the rest of the flat. The bedroom was as spare as a cell. The bed was made with hospital corners. In the wardrobe, clothes hung with military spacing. He checked pockets, felt for false backs. Nothing.

In the small bathroom, he finally saw her. Not her, but the evidence of her. A particular brand of moisturiser. A hairbrush with long, dark strands caught in its bristles. A toothbrush, dry and hard. It was the only room that felt vaguely lived-in, and even here, the austerity was profound.

He was about to leave when he saw it. Taped to the underside of the toilet cistern lid, a small, waterproof pouch. He peeled it off. Inside was a single sheet of paper, folded tight. He unfolded it, angling it towards the window’s grey light.

It was a list. Dates. Amounts. Initials. Bank routing codes. It wasn’t the ledger. It was a sample. A teaser. At the bottom, in her precise, looping hand, was written: *For verification. The full record is secure. Contact destroys it.*

She had been prepared for this. For a meeting gone wrong. For someone coming to her flat. She had left a bone for the dogs, hoping they’d be satisfied. The real meat was elsewhere, with a trigger on it.

The key in his pocket felt heavier. Number 417. It could be in any bank, any building society, any private vault in the city. It was a needle, and Glasgow was a haystack of dark stone and darker secrets.

A floorboard creaked in the close outside.

Donnie froze, the paper held rigid in his hand. It wasn’t the settling groan of an old building. It was the careful, weight-distributing step of a man trying to be quiet.

He moved fast. He flushed the toilet, the sudden, roaring noise shocking in the silence, and stuffed the sample page into his inside pocket. He slipped out of the bathroom, across the dark living room, to the door. He didn’t put his ear to it. He looked through the fisheye lens.

The landing was empty. But the light from the streetlamp below cast a long shadow up the stairwell. A shadow that didn’t move.

They were here. They were already on the stairs.

He looked back into the flat. The only other way out was the window in the living room. A three-storey drop onto concrete. A broken leg was a death sentence now.

The shadow on the stairwell shifted. A foot appeared on the landing, then another. The bearded man. He was alone. He stood before Sarah Cowie’s door, his head tilted, listening. He didn’t try the handle. He just waited.

Donnie held his breath. His heart was a slow, cold drum in his chest. The man outside was a hunter who knew his prey was near. He was waiting for a sound, a vibration, the faintest sign of life.

From downstairs, a door opened. An old woman’s voice, querulous and thin. “Is that you, Mr. Kincaid? I heard a right commotion earlier.”

The bearded man’s voice, warm, friendly. “Evening, Mrs. Gow. Just checking on a leak for the factor. Sorry to disturb you.”

“A leak? Up there? She’s never in, that one. Quiet as a mouse.”

“Aye, well, better safe than sorry. You have a good night, now.”

The door closed. The friendly mask dropped away. The silence returned, thicker now.

Donnie knew the calculus. The man wouldn’t wait forever. He would call for back-up, or he would come in. The flat was a trap about to spring.

He looked at the window again. Then he looked at the door. At the hinges. They were on the inside.

He moved to the kitchen, soundless on the thin carpet. He opened a drawer. Cutlery. He selected the heaviest knife, a broad-bladed chef’s knife. He went back to the door, knelt, and placed the tip of the blade against the wood of the frame, just above the bottom hinge. He positioned his palm against the hilt, took a breath, and drove the blade in with a single, solid thrust of his body weight.

The sound was a deep, splitting *crunch*. It echoed in the silent flat.

On the landing, the bearded man moved. Donnie heard the swift scuff of shoes, then a shoulder hit the door, hard. The lock held, but the wood around it splintered.

Donnie was already at the window. He threw the catch, shoved the sash up. The cold, wet night air rushed in. He didn’t look down. He swung a leg over the sill, grabbed the frame, and pivoted out, searching with his foot for the cast-iron drainpipe he’d spotted from the street.

His foot found it. It was cold, wet, and slick. He transferred his weight, his body hanging out over the void, the rain needling his face. He heard the door to the flat burst inwards, a crash of wood and a curse.

He started to climb down, hand under hand, feet braced against the brickwork. The pipe groaned and rattled in its brackets. Above him, a head appeared at the window. The bearded man. Their eyes met for a split second in the gloom. There was no anger in the man’s face. Just a kind of weary professionalism.

Donnie let go.

He dropped the last ten feet, landing in a crouch on the sodden grass of the back court, the impact jolting up through his ankles. He was up and running before the shock had faded, across the broken paving, through a gap in a fence, into the labyrinth of back greens and lanes.

He ran until the burn in his lungs matched the deep, cold ache in his bones. He stopped in the lee of a railway arch, the bag of his wet clothes still clutched in his hand, the key and the sample page burning against his chest. He had the key. He had a sample. He had a city full of boxes numbered 417.

And he had a man with a beard who had looked at him not with malice, but with the calm certainty of a fisherman who knows the net is strong and the river is long. The chase was no longer about evidence. It was about endurance. About who would freeze, or starve, or make a fatal mistake first in the endless, weeping rain.

The hook was no longer in the water. It was in him, buried deep, and the line was being played out down every dark street and close, leading back to a man in a dry office, waiting for the tug that meant the fight was over.

# Chapter 21

## **CHAPTER 21**

The rain under the railway arch was a different beast. It didn’t fall, it gathered. It dripped from the rusted iron in fat, deliberate globes that hit the puddled ground with a sound like a slow clock. Donnie stood in the deepest shadow, his back against the cold, wet brick, and waited for his heart to stop trying to batter its way out of his ribs. The bag of wet clothes was a dead weight in his hand. He let it drop. It landed with a sodden slap.

He fumbled inside his jacket, his fingers numb. He found the key first, its teeth biting into his palm. Then the folded page, damp at the edges from his own sweat. He didn’t need to look at it. The numbers were etched behind his eyes now. 417. A box number. A coffin for secrets. The sample was useless to him, a piece of a ledger he couldn’t read, but it was proof. It was a thing that existed. That mattered.

The man’s face mattered more. That look. Weary. Professional. It was the look of a man doing a job of work, a man who had seen runners before, who knew the statistics of panic and misstep. Donnie had seen it on cops, on bailiffs, on the security at the Barras market moving on a stallholder who hadn’t paid his backhander. It was the look of the system, impersonal and immense. It chilled him more than the rain ever could.

He pushed off from the wall. He couldn’t stay here. The arch was a trap, a single exit. He moved out from under its shelter, back into the slanting rain. He kept to the backs, a ghost in a city of ghosts, navigating by the yellowed squares of kitchen windows and the skeletal outlines of washing poles. His mind, detached from the burn in his legs and the cold seeping into his marrow, began to work.

A key. A box number. A city.

It wasn’t a post office. They’d have records, cameras. It wasn’t a left-luggage at the stations—too public, too temporary. This was private. Secure. For people who needed to hide things, not store them. He thought of the businesses that thrived in the grey spaces: the lock-ups under the motorway, the private storage yards out by the river, the discreet little outfits that asked no questions and took cash.

He needed a phone. A library. A connection to the world before the internet, the world of paper directories and word-of-mouth. He needed Archie.

But Archie was a thread that led back to him. If they were watching the funeral, if they had his name from the tenement, they’d be watching Archie. The *Clansman*. All the old seams. The line was being played out, and every familiar touch was a potential snag.

He came out onto a main road, the sodium lights making the wet tarmac gleam like rancid butter. A night bus hissed past, empty save for a lone figure slumped against the window. Donnie turned his face away. He walked for another twenty minutes, the purposeful trudge of a man going home from a late shift, until he found what he was looking for: a public phone box, its glass fogged and streaked, the directory a gutted carcass hanging from a chain.

The phone itself was a miracle. It took his coins. He dialled a number from memory, a number for a cab office in Govan that wasn’t a cab office. It rang five times before it was picked up. No greeting.

“It’s Donnie.”

A pause. A slow exhalation of smoke. “You’re a popular boy.”

“Am I?”

“Aye. Questions being asked. Polite questions. The kind that come with expensive shoes and no sense of humour.” It was Tam, his voice a dry rustle. “You’ve stirred up a midden, son. What do you need?”

“Information. Storage. Private, discreet. The kind you pay for in cash and never see a face.”

Tam was silent for a long moment. “You’re asking me to point a finger.”

“I’m asking you to point at a street. A name. Not a person.”

Another drag on the cigarette. “There’s a place. Down by the river, off the Springfield Quay. Used to be a bonded warehouse. Now it’s… units. Heated, dry, secure. You get a key. They get a number. No names. You know the type.”

“A name, Tam.”

“Clyde Storage Solutions.” Tam said it with a faint sneer. “A solution for problems that need hiding. You didn’t get it from me.”

“Who runs it?”

“You think I ask? It exists. That’s all you need to know. Now, do me a favour and lose this number. My shoes aren’t that expensive.” The line went dead.

Donnie replaced the receiver. The plastic was warm where his hand had been. Clyde Storage Solutions. It fit. Impersonal. Corporate. A front for a vault.

He had a destination. He had no way to get there without being a moving target. He left the phone box and melted back into the side streets, heading east, away from the river, a feint. He needed to see the lay of the land, to understand the net.

He found a café that was open, a greasy spoon with steamed windows and the smell of old fat. He took a booth at the back, ordered a tea he didn’t want. He sat facing the door, the key and the page a hard lump against his chest. The few other customers were night workers, taxi drivers and cleaners, hunched over mugs, lost in their own exhaustion. He was just another face.

He watched the street through a clear patch on the glass. The rain softened the lights, made the world a blur of movement. A car slowed outside. A dark saloon. It didn’t stop. It crawled past, then picked up speed and was gone. Donnie’s muscles, which had tightened, slowly unclenched. Paranoia was a luxury he couldn’t afford. It was just a tool now, like the key. A thing to be used.

He sipped the scalding, bitter tea. The chase was about endurance, yes. But it was also about pattern. The man with the beard was professional. He would work a grid. He would cover the obvious: Donnie’s known haunts, his friends, the funeral. He would assume Donnie would run, or hide, or try to use what he had. The smart move, the move the fisherman would expect, was to go to ground or to bolt for the box.

So Donnie wouldn’t do that. Not yet.

He paid for the tea with exact change and went back out into the rain. He walked north, towards the Necropolis. It was a long trek, through sleeping streets and past the dark, silent bulk of the cathedral. The rain had eased to a fine, persistent mist that hung in the air like cold breath. The city was at its quietest, that dead hour before the first lorries rumbled towards the markets.

He climbed the slippery path into the city of the dead. The tombstones and monuments loomed out of the gloom, angels and obelisks rendered shapeless by the dark. He knew where he was going. He’d been up here a hundred times as a boy, daring each other to run through the graves at midnight. He moved silently, his footsteps swallowed by the wet grass.

He found a vantage point behind a large, ornate mausoleum, its door sealed with a rusted padlock. From here, he could see the eastern gate, the paths that led up to the newer plots. The funeral was hours away. But if they were watching, they would be here early. They would want to see who came, who lingered, who showed an interest.

He settled in to wait. The cold seeped up from the ground, through the soles of his shoes. It was a deep, patient cold, the cold of the earth itself. He welcomed it. It kept him sharp. He watched the gate, the streetlights beyond casting weak, yellow pools on the empty road.

An hour passed. The mist shifted, coiling around the monuments. Then, just as the first faint greyness touched the eastern sky, he saw it. A van, plain white, parked down a side street opposite the gate. No logo. Its windows were faintly fogged. As Donnie watched, the driver’s side window slid down an inch. A hand emerged, tapped ash from a cigarette.

They were here. Not the bearded man, perhaps, but a part of the net. Watching the obvious place. Waiting for the mouse to show itself at the cheese.

A grim, cold satisfaction settled in Donnie’s gut. He had their measure. They were good, but they were predictable. They thought in lines, in grids. They didn’t understand the city, not the way he did. The city wasn’t a grid; it was an organism, a tangle of old wounds and new growth, of shortcuts that weren’t on any map, of loyalties that didn’t show up on any report.

He stayed until the sky lightened to a dirty pewter, until the van’s engine started and it pulled away, its job done for now. They’d be back for the funeral itself. He waited another ten minutes, then moved, slipping down a different path, out through a broken part of the wall onto a quiet residential street.

He had time. He had a direction. And he had an advantage they didn’t know about: he had seen the net, and he knew he was already through one of its holes.

He made his way down towards the Clyde, not directly, but in a wide, meandering arc that took him through the Gorbals, across the river at the Albert Bridge, then back along the south bank. The industrial past here was a skeleton picked clean, the old docks and yards now given over to car parks and retail units with names that promised a future that never quite arrived. The river was a broad, black slab, its surface puckered by the rain.

He found Springfield Quay. It was a development of flats and a cinema, bright and sanitised. But behind it, accessed by a service road that dipped down towards the water, was a long, low building of soot-stained brick. No sign. Just a number. And a small, discreet plaque by a heavy steel door: *Clyde Storage Solutions – Access By Keycard & Appointment*.

It looked closed. Fortified. A bunker.

Donnie didn’t approach the main door. He kept walking, past it, towards the river. There was a walkway here, and beyond it, the old quay itself, a concrete apron littered with chains and bollards. He leaned on the railing, pretending to watch the water, and studied the building.

It had few windows, and those were high, frosted glass. Cameras were mounted at each corner, their little red lights winking in the gloom. A single delivery bay was closed by a roll-down shutter. It was a vault. Tam was right.

He had the key. He had the number. But walking up to that door and trying the key was suicide. The cameras would see him. The system would log the attempt. The bearded man and his employers would know he was here, that he was close. They would converge. The net would tighten.

He needed a different way in. A way that didn’t involve the front door.

He turned from the river and walked back up to the street. He found a newsagent’s, bought a cheap pay-as-you-go phone with cash. Then he walked until he found a quiet bench, sheltered from the worst of the rain by a bus stop. He took out the new phone and dialled the number for Clyde Storage Solutions listed in the online directory he’d looked up in the library two days prior.

A woman’s voice answered, crisp and efficient. “Clyde Storage, how may I direct your call?”

“I need to speak to someone about accessing a unit,” Donnie said, putting a layer of weary frustration into his voice. “My father’s passed. He’s got a unit with yous. Number 417. I’ve got the key, but I don’t have the paperwork. Solicitor says it’s a mess. I just need to get his things, for the funeral.”

A pause. Keys tapped. “I’m sorry for your loss, sir. Unit 417. I can see it here. I’m afraid access is strictly via the registered key and the keycard. No paperwork, no access. It’s in our terms.”

“Aye, but he’s *deid*,” Donnie pressed, the Glasgow irritation rising. “The keycard’s probably in his wallet they burnt with him. I’ve got the metal key. Can I no’ just come down, show you the death cert, you let me in? It’s just some old papers he wanted kept safe.”

“I’m very sorry, sir. The system is automated for security. The door unlocks only with a valid keycard swipe, then the individual key for the unit. Without the card, I cannot help you. You would need to contact the executor of the estate and have them apply for a lost card, with notarised documentation. It takes seven to ten working days.”

“Seven to ten days? He’s getting buried the morn!”

“I do apologise, sir. There is no override.” Her voice was a wall of polite, unyielding concrete.

Donnie let a string of muttered curses sound down the line, then sighed, defeated. “Right. Fine. Thanks for nothing.” He hung up.

So. A two-part lock. A keycard for the building, then the physical key for the box. He had half the solution. Getting the other half would require stealing a card from an employee, or hacking a system he couldn’t see. Both were beyond him. He was a chancer, a runner, not a cat burglar.

He sat on the bench as the morning traffic built around him. The hook was in him, deep, and the line was taut. He was here, at the source, and he was blocked. The man in the dry office had designed this well. It was a test. A filter. To see how clever, how desperate, the mouse could be.

Desperation. That was a currency he understood.

He got up and started walking again, not with any clear direction now, just moving to think. He passed a building site, its perimeter fence plastered with artist’s impressions of future luxury apartments. He passed a pub being hosed down by a bored-looking man. He passed a charity shop where a volunteer was putting out a rack of donated coats.

He stopped. He looked at the coats. Heavy winter things, donated by people who had moved on, or died, or simply bought something new.

An idea, fragile and full of holes, began to form.

He went into the shop. The bell tinkled. The volunteer, an older woman with kind eyes, smiled at him. “Just put the kettle on, love. You’re my first customer.”

“Just browsing,” Donnie said, his voice rough.

He went to the rack of coats. He found a long, dark waterproof, stained and worn but serviceable. He found a woollen hat. A scarf. He took them to the counter.

“Three pound for the lot,” the woman said. “You look perished.”

He paid with his last coins. In the cramped little toilet at the back of the shop, he changed. He put his own jacket in the charity shop’s plastic bag, folded it small. He put on the waterproof, the hat, the scarf. He looked at himself in the cracked mirror. He looked like a down-and-out, a homeless man. Invisible.

It was a disguise, but a real one. It was the armour of the ignored.

He left the shop, his old life in a bag. He walked back towards the river, towards the storage facility, but he didn’t go to the front door. He went back to the quay walkway. He found a semi-sheltered spot, a recessed doorway for a long-defunct riverboat ticket office, and he settled there. He arranged the plastic bag as a seat. He hunched his shoulders, pulled the hat down, and became part of the scenery.

He was going to wait. He was going to watch. He was going to learn the rhythm of the place. The deliveries. The employees. The smokers on their breaks. He was going to look for the flaw, the crack in the polite, unyielding concrete. Because there always was one. It was the first rule of the city: nothing was ever as solid as it looked.

The rain began again, a steady, soaking drizzle. Donnie McCallum, in his borrowed armour, lowered his head and endured. The river flowed past, black and silent, on its way to the sea. The net was out there, in the city, being drawn slowly in. But here, at its very centre, he was still. He was a stone in the riverbed, waiting for the current to show him which way to move. The key was cold against his skin. The sample page was a promise. The chase was no longer about running.

It was about becoming something else. Something they wouldn’t think to catch.

# Chapter 22

## **CHAPTER 22**

The rain on the quay walkway wasn’t a drizzle anymore, it was a seep. It didn’t fall so much as it hung in the air, a cold, persistent mist that coated everything in a film of damp. It found its way past the collar of the charity-shop waterproof, down the back of Donnie’s neck. It beaded on the coarse wool of the hat. He was a statue in a recessed doorway, a part of the urban geology. The river, a slick of oiled slate, moved with a silent, muscular patience beside him.

He’d been there for hours. The light had bled from a dull afternoon into a thick, sodium-vapour evening. The storage facility across the road was a fortress of corrugated steel and polite, impossible rules. A polite fortress. The most dangerous kind.

He’d learned the rhythm. The smokers’ breaks were at ten past the hour, every hour. Two women in high-vis vests, sharing a single cigarette and a gripe about the roster. A security guard on his own at half-past, a big man who checked his phone and stared at the river as if it had an answer for him. A delivery van at 4:15pm, a man in a uniform who buzzed, was admitted, and emerged twelve minutes later with a dolly and three identical cardboard boxes. Donnie watched it all from behind the curtain of his own breath, his borrowed invisibility.

The flaw wasn’t in the people. It was in the building itself.

He’d seen it just as the last of the grey daylight surrendered. A gutter, running down the side wall of the facility, had pulled away from its fixings near the roofline. It sagged, a black plastic intestine, dribbling its overflow down the brickwork in a dark, spreading stain. Directly beneath it, maybe eight feet off the ground, was a window. Not one of the big, front-facing ones for the customer lobby. A smaller, dirtier one. An office, maybe. A staff toilet. It was framed in peeling white uPVC. And from his angle, hunched in the shadows, Donnie could see a sliver of something at its base. A warping. A bow in the frame where the constant drip from the broken gutter had done its work.

Wood rots. Plastic becomes brittle. Politeness cracks under neglect.

He waited until full dark. Until the smokers had had their last break and the security guard had made his final external patrol, a torch beam sweeping the empty car park with a tired, predictable arc. Donnie moved then. Not with purpose, but with the slow, shuffling gait of the homeless seeking a drier spot. He crossed the road, head down, the plastic bag with his old jacket clutched to his chest. He didn’t look at the cameras. He was beneath them. He was part of the weather.

He shuffled along the side of the building, into the narrow service alley that stank of wet bins and pigeon shit. The dripping gutter was louder here, a steady *plink-plonk* into a puddle of black water. He stood under the window, looking up. The warped section was at the bottom left corner. He reached up. The wall was rough, cold brick. There were pipes, old iron ones, bolted to the wall. Brackets. Handholds for a desperate man.

He stashed the plastic bag behind a overflowing wheelie bin. He spat on his palms, rubbed them on the damp waterproof. Then he began to climb.

It wasn’t elegant. It was a graceless, straining scramble, feet scrabbling for purchase on slick brick, fingers hooking into pipe brackets, pulling his weight up. The waterproof snagged and tore. His breath came in ragged gasps that he fought to keep silent. He was a middle-aged man climbing a wall in the rain, and every muscle, every old twinge from a lifetime of hard living, screamed at him. He ignored them. He focused on the warp in the window frame.

He got a foothold on a stout pipe bracket, his body pressed flat against the wall. He was level with the window. He took the key from around his neck, the one from the lawyer’s envelope. He didn’t try the lock. He wedged the thickest part of the key’s bow into the gap at the warped corner. He leaned his weight into it, slowly, steadily. The uPVC groaned. A low, protesting sound, lost in the patter of the drip and the distant hum of the city. He shifted the key, worked it along the seam. The groan became a crack. A sharp, brittle snap.

The window gave, not with a swing, but with a jolt inward. The lock had held, but the frame had split around it. He shoved, and the whole unit tilted inwards, jammed at a crazy angle. It was enough. A gap, maybe eighteen inches high. A dark mouth.

Donnie hauled himself through, collapsing onto a cold linoleum floor. He lay there for a moment, listening, the rain on his back, the city’s breath held outside. The air inside was stale, smelling of bleach and dust. A janitor’s closet. Mops and buckets, shelves of cleaning fluids. A single, bare bulb with a pull-cord.

He didn’t pull it.

He got to his feet, closed the broken window as best he could. It sat crooked, a tell-tale sign. But it would have to do. He eased the closet door open. A dimly lit corridor, the kind with scuffed floors and fire extinguishers behind glass. He could hear the low thrum of the building’s heating system, nothing else. It was after hours. The polite fortress was asleep.

He moved like a ghost, his damp trainers making no sound. He passed empty offices, their desks neat, chairs tucked in. A kitchenette with a humming fridge. He found the main customer area, a vast, brightly lit space of orange lockers and rolling steel doors. It was eerily quiet, a cathedral to other people’s junk. His eyes went to the wall of smaller units, the private lockers. Number 417.

It was on the third row up. He’d need a ladder. One was clipped to a rail nearby, a tall, aluminium thing on wheels. He rolled it over, the wheels squeaking a protest that echoed in the vastness. He climbed, the key cold and sure in his hand.

The lock turned with a smooth, well-oiled *clunk*. A sound of finality. He pulled the steel door up. It rolled back with a rumble that seemed deafening.

The locker was not large. And it was not full. A single, gunmetal-grey safe sat inside, bolted to the floor of the locker. A digital keypad glowed with a soft, green light on its front. No keyhole. Just numbers.

Donnie stared at it. The key in his hand was useless. This was the next lock. The next test.

He sat on the top of the ladder, his legs dangling, and looked at the safe. He thought of the sample page. *Follow the money.* He thought of the lawyer, Greer, his careful, dead-man’s instructions. A key for a locker. A locker for a safe. A safe for… what? More instructions? The truth itself?

He reached out, touched the cold metal of the safe. It was solid. Implacable. A perfect, polished full stop.

The numbers. It would be a code. A date? A birthday? Margaret’s? His own? He tried the date on the sample page. Nothing. The date of the funeral. Nothing. The lawyer’s office suite number. Nothing. The green light turned red, beeped a soft, mocking alarm. A thirty-second lockout.

He waited, the silence of the storage hall pressing in on him. He was inside the net, now. Sitting in its very belly. He thought of Margaret, of her sharp eyes and her sharper mind. She wouldn’t have made it easy. She would have known they’d pressure Greer. They’d find the key. She would have layered it. She would have spoken to him in a language only they shared.

He thought of the *Clansman*. Of a rainy afternoon, a game of dominoes. Her voice, smoky with cigarettes and scorn for the man on the telly. *“See him? All flash, no foundation. Built on sand, Donnie. The only numbers that matter are the ones nobody sees. The ones you carry right here.”* She’d tapped her temple. Then, she’d laughed. *“Or the ones you forget on purpose. Like my old PIN. 2410. The date that daft laddie from the bakery stood me up. I kept it for years to remind myself never to be that bloody stupid again.”*

2410.

The lockout period ended. The green light glowed. Donnie, his heart a dull hammer against his ribs, pressed the numbers. 2. 4. 1. 0.

A deeper *clunk*, from within the safe. A hydraulic sigh. The door swung open, heavy and silent.

Inside, no stacks of paper. No bundles of cash. No gleaming sample.

There was a single, old-fashioned Dictaphone. A small, black plastic thing. And beside it, a stack of ten micro-cassettes, each labelled in Margaret’s precise, looping hand with a date and a single initial. ‘K’. ‘L’. ‘M’. ‘S’.

Donnie picked up the Dictaphone. It felt heavy, final. He pressed play.

*“Test, test… right.”* Her voice filled the silent locker hall, tinny through the small speaker but utterly, unmistakably hers. The sound of it was a punch to his chest. *“If you’re hearing this, Donnie, then you’re in the locker. And you remembered the bakery boy. Good lad. I knew you were listening, even when you pretended you weren’t.”* A pause, the faint hiss of tape. *“The key was the easy bit. This… this is the hard part. The tapes. They’re not my story. They’re theirs. Every meeting, every arrangement, every whispered promise and every bloody threat. For years. I recorded them. A woman’s got to protect herself, hasn’t she? Especially when she’s swimming with sharks.”*

Donnie’s hand was trembling. He looked at the stack of tapes. Ten. A decade of secrets.

*“They’re all here,”* Margaret’s voice continued, lower now. *“K for Kyle. L for Laird. M for MacIntyre. S for Sweeney. The four pillars of their polite little kingdom. Their voices, their plans. Their murders. It’s all here. The sample page was just a taste. This is the whole rotten meal.”* Another pause. He could hear her lighting a cigarette, the soft inhale. *“This isn’t a weapon for you to use, Donnie. It’s a bomb. And you’re not the bomber. You’re the postman. Your job is to deliver it. To the only person they can’t touch. The only person who might, just might, give a damn. His name and address are on a card taped to the bottom of the safe. You take the whole lot to him. You don’t listen to the rest. You don’t look at the card until you’re clear. Then you run. You run and you don’t look back. This is my mess. My vengeance. You’re just the last errand. Be a good lad. And for Christ’s sake, be careful.”*

The tape clicked off.

Donnie sat in the vast, silent hall, the Dictaphone whirring softly in his hand. The weight of it. The weight of her trust. It was crushing. He wasn’t holding a secret. He was holding a city’s worth of poison, distilled onto ten tiny tapes.

He looked at the safe. He reached in, felt along the cold metal bottom. His fingers found it. A small rectangle of card, held fast with brittle yellow tape. He peeled it off, but didn’t look. He shoved it deep into the pocket of the waterproof, with the key. He put the Dictaphone and the stack of tapes into the plastic bag from the charity shop, nestling them beside his old jacket. He closed the safe door. It locked with a definitive *thud*. He rolled the locker door down, locked it with the key. He descended the ladder, rolled it back to its place.

He was retracing his steps, the bag of secrets heavy in his hand, when he heard it.

Not from outside. From within the building.

A door closing. A soft, deliberate click. Then footsteps. Not the shuffling tread of a nightwatchman. These were firm, measured. Coming down the main corridor, towards the locker hall.

Donnie froze, pressed back into the shadow of a tall storage rack. He saw the beam of a torch first, slicing through the gloom. Then the figure holding it. Not the security guard from earlier. This man was thinner, dressed in dark, functional clothing. He moved with a predatory ease, the torch beam sweeping across locker numbers. He stopped. The beam settled on locker 417.

Donnie held his breath. The man stood there, staring at the closed locker door. Then, slowly, he raised the torch, letting the light travel up the wall, across the ceiling. It passed over the spot where Donnie had climbed in, but the broken window was around the corner, out of sight. The beam came down, swept across the floor. It paused. It illuminated the faint, damp footprints Donnie had left on the linoleum, leading from the janitor’s closet corridor.

The man’s head turned, following the trail. The torch beam lifted, travelled across the floor, and stopped.

It landed directly on Donnie’s damp trainers, visible at the edge of the storage rack.

The light didn’t waver. A voice, calm and devoid of any accent, any emotion, cut through the silence.

“Mr. McCallum. We’ve been waiting for you to make your move. Why don’t you come out? Let’s have a chat about what you’ve found.”

Donnie didn’t move. The bag with the tapes felt like a live thing in his hand. The net wasn’t just outside. It was in here with him. It had been waiting. The polite fortress had a polite keeper, and he was standing in the light, between Donnie and the broken window, between Donnie and the river, between Donnie and the last errand.

The man took a step forward. The torch beam held steady on Donnie’s feet.

“There’s nowhere to go,” the voice said, almost kindly. “The building is sealed. It’s just you, me, and whatever Margaret left for you. Let’s make this civilised.”

Donnie looked at the bag. He looked at the pool of light on the floor. He thought of the river, black and patient. Of becoming a stone. A stone could be still. But a stone could also be thrown.

He let the plastic bag drop silently into the deep shadow at the base of the storage rack. He took one step forward, out of the darkness and into the edge of the torchlight.

“Civilised,” Donnie said, his voice a dry rasp in the hollow hall. “Aye. Why not.”

He stood there, empty-handed, as the man with the torch took another step closer. The game had changed. The chase was over. Now it was a transaction. And he had to decide what price to pay for the ten small cassettes lying in the dark behind him, and the name on the card burning a hole in his pocket.

# Chapter 23

## **CHAPTER 23**

The torch beam was a white-hot brand on his chest. Donnie stood in its centre, a specimen pinned to the dark. He kept his hands loose at his sides, empty palms facing out. The man holding the light was a silhouette, a cut-out of deeper black against the gloom of the warehouse hall. He was tall, but not bulky. The kind of build that suggested efficiency, not force. The polite voice had no source Donnie could fix on; it seemed to come from the air itself, from the dust motes dancing in the punishing light.

“Step forward, please. Into the light fully.”

Donnie took two more steps. The linoleum was gritty under his trainers. He was out of the shadow of the rack now, exposed. The plastic bag with the tapes was a continent away, back in the dark. The man lowered the torch slightly, so it wasn’t blinding, but kept it fixed on Donnie’s face. The light spilled around him, illuminating his own features in reverse: a sharp, intelligent face, hair cropped short, eyes that didn’t reflect the beam but seemed to absorb it. He wore a dark, practical jacket, trousers, boots. Nothing that said police. Nothing that said anything at all.

“My name is Carrington,” the man said. It was a statement, not an introduction. “You’ve been busy, Mr. McCallum.”

“Just out for a walk.”

“In a derelict bonded warehouse. Through a river tunnel. With a set of bolt cutters.” Carrington’s tone was that of a tutor correcting a minor, forgivable error. “You left a clear trail. The mud from the tunnel. The footprints. The broken window was a nice touch. Theatrical.”

Donnie said nothing. The man’s calm was a colder thing than any shouted threat. It was the calm of absolute control.

“You have something that belongs to my employers,” Carrington continued. “Ten audio cassettes. In a plastic bag. You dropped it when I illuminated you. It’s currently approximately two metres behind you, at the base of the third storage rack. You also have a business card. In your left jacket pocket. A name. We’d like both.”

The net wasn’t just here. It had been drawn tight around every step he’d taken since he’d left the *Clansman*. They’d known about the tunnel. They’d let him come. They’d herded him here, to this polite dead-end.

“Who’s ‘we’?” Donnie asked, his voice still rough.

“That’s not a productive question. The items, please. You retrieve the bag. You hand over the card. Then you walk out of here. The door behind me is open. You go back to your life. Such as it is.”

“And if I say no?”

Carrington’s head tilted a fraction. “Then I take them from you. And you do not walk out. The river is right there. It’s swallowed worse. It’s a very local solution to a universal problem. Men like you disappear every day. No one looks too hard.”

The local universal. A body in the Clyde. A stone in the dark. It was the oldest story this city had. Donnie felt the weight of it, the sheer, grinding inevitability. He was a man from the Gallowgate, standing in a dead place, being offered a choice by a man with no accent. Die for a secret, or live with the knowledge that he’d handed it over. That Margaret’s last errand had ended with him capitulating to a polite man in a dark room.

He thought of her voice on the tapes. Not the politics, not the names. The *weariness*. The cost. She hadn’t sent him for this to end with a tidy transaction. She’d sent him because she knew he was a stone. And a stone, once set rolling, couldn’t just stop because a light was shone on it.

“I need to know what’s on them,” Donnie said, not moving. “She asked me to deliver them. I need to know what I’m delivering. Or what I’m selling.”

Carrington was silent for a long moment. The torch beam didn’t waver. “Ignorance is your currency here, Mr. McCallum. Spend it. Buy your life.”

“Not good enough.”

“It’s the only offer on the table.”

Donnie looked past the light, into the darkness where Carrington’s face was. “You could’ve taken the bag already. You knew where it was. You could’ve shot me in the dark and taken it. But you didn’t. You want me to hand it over. You want the card from my pocket. Why? Because it needs to be voluntary? A clean chain of custody?” He took a slow breath, the damp, metallic air filling his lungs. “Or because you need to know if I’ve listened to them? If the secret’s already out?”

The silence that followed was different. It was no longer just empty; it was charged, like the air before a breaker trips. Carrington had not accounted for this. For the logic of the street, which was always, at its root, about leverage.

“Have you?” Carrington asked, the kindness gone, replaced by a blade’s edge.

“What’s it worth to you to find out?”

It was the wrong play. He knew it as soon as he said it. You didn’t bluff with a man who held all the cards and the deck and the table. Carrington moved. Not a lunge, but a smooth, economic step forward, closing the distance. His free hand came up. In it was a small, black pistol, suppressed, ugly in its functionality. It was levelled at Donnie’s forehead.

“The cost of curiosity just went up,” Carrington said. “Retrieve the bag. Now.”

This was the darkness. The torch beam and the gun and the silent, sealed building. The net was not just around him; it was inside his chest, tightening with every heartbeat. Every thread led here: to a choice between a bullet or a betrayal. There was no third way. No last-minute save. This was the polished floor of the abyss.

Donnie turned, slowly, his back to the gun. He walked the two metres back to the storage rack, his legs heavy. He knelt. The darkness here was absolute, a pool of ink. He felt for the plastic bag, his fingers finding the damp, gritty handles. He had a wild, stupid thought of swinging it, of the tapes becoming a flail. It would get him shot. It would achieve nothing. Margaret’s voice was in his head, not from the tapes, but from a memory, sitting in her stifling front room: *“It’s never about the big stand, Donnie. It’s about the small, stupid, right thing. The one they don’t see coming.”*

What was the small, stupid, right thing here?

He stood up, holding the bag. He turned back to the light. He walked towards Carrington, the bag held out in front of him like an offering.

“And the card,” Carrington said, the gun unwavering.

Donnie shifted the bag to his left hand. With his right, he reached into his inside jacket pocket. His fingers brushed the stiff card. He pulled it out. He held it in the light between them. The name was upside down to him, but he knew what it said. The final piece of Margaret’s puzzle.

He took the last step, closing the final gap. He was within arm’s reach of Carrington now. He could see the man’s eyes. They were a flat, neutral grey. He held out the bag and the card together.

Carrington’s gaze flicked down for a split second, confirming the items.

In that split second, Donnie moved.

He didn’t go for the gun. He didn’t swing the bag. He dropped the card. It fluttered to the floor. As Carrington’s eyes instinctively followed it, Donnie’s right hand, now empty, shot forward not to strike, but to grab. He grabbed the wrist of the hand holding the torch, yanking it down and across his body, hard. The beam slashed wildly across the ceiling.

The gun fired.

The sound was a soft, deep *phut*, like a book dropped on a carpet. The round went wide, smacking into the concrete floor somewhere to Donnie’s left. Carrington was strong, trained, already reacting, a knee coming up towards Donnie’s groin. Donnie twisted, taking the blow on his thigh, a bolt of numbness shooting down his leg. He headbutted forward, not aiming for the face, but for the torch hand again, smashing his forehead against Carrington’s knuckles.

There was a crunch. The torch flew from the man’s grip, clattering across the linoleum, its beam spinning, a dizzy pinwheel of light that finally settled pointing at a wall, throwing their struggling, giant shadows across it.

They were in near-darkness now, only the distant, skewed torchlight illuminating them. Donnie had the bag still in his left hand. It was a handicap. Carrington drove an elbow into his ribs. Breath exploded from Donnie’s lungs. He staggered back, but didn’t let go of the man’s wrist. He pulled with all his weight, using Carrington’s own momentum to unbalance him.

They fell together, a tangle of limbs, hitting the ground with a jarring thud. The gun was between them. Donnie could feel the cold metal against his stomach. He drove his own knee up, finding a softness. Carrington grunted, his grip slackening for a moment. Donnie scrabbled for the gun, his fingers closing over the textured grip. He wrenched it free.

He rolled away, coming up onto his knees, the gun now in his hand, pointed shakily at the dark shape of Carrington who was also rising, a panther uncoiling.

“Don’t,” Donnie gasped, the pain in his ribs a sharp stitch.

Carrington froze. He was a silhouette again. He straightened up slowly, brushing dust from his jacket. He was breathing hard, but his voice, when it came, was still under that frightening control. “You won’t use that.”

“Try me.”

“If you were going to, you already would have. You’re not a shooter, McCallum. You’re a messenger. A delivery boy who got lost.”

The words were meant to sting, to provoke. Donnie felt them land. They were true. The gun was a foreign, hateful weight in his hand. It was the end of every line of thought he’d ever had. He wasn’t Archie. He wasn’t a hardman. He was a man who watched the rain and remembered the feel of a chip bag growing sodden.

“The bag,” Carrington said, taking a slow step forward. “Put it down. Put the gun down. Walk away. This is your last chance to be civilised.”

Civilised. The word hung in the damp air. This wasn’t civilisation. This was the polished mechanism that ran beneath it. The quiet men in quiet rooms who made the problems go away. Who turned people into stones and dropped them in the river.

Donnie’s finger found the trigger. The curve of it was cool.

He saw Carrington tense, ready to spring the moment the barrel wavered.

And then, from the far end of the hall, from the direction of the open door Carrington had mentioned, came a new sound.

Footsteps. Not one set. Several. Slow, deliberate, spreading out.

A torch beam, different, broader, swept across the distant wall.

Then a voice, familiar, gravelly, echoing in the vast space. “Donnie? You in here, ya daft bastard?”

Archie.

Another voice, higher, strained. “Mr. McCallum? It’s Moira. Moira from the library. We… we followed you. We saw the car outside.”

Carrington’s head snapped towards the sound. For the first time, his perfect composure cracked. A flicker of pure, incandescent fury. This was not in the script. This was messy. This was local. This was witnesses.

Donnie didn’t think. He acted. He threw the plastic bag. Not at Carrington, but sideways, into the deep black between two storage racks. It vanished with a soft rustle.

“The game’s changed,” Donnie hissed at Carrington. “You want to shoot me now? In front of them? How’s that for a local solution?”

Carrington’s eyes locked with his. The calculation there was swift, brutal. A public death, even here, was a complication. A spectacle. It created threads, not cut them.

“This isn’t over,” Carrington said, the words a cold promise. He took a step back, then another, melting into the shadow of the rack opposite the one where the bag had disappeared.

“Donnie!” Archie’s voice was closer now. His torch beam found Donnie, kneeling on the floor, the gun in his hand. Archie stopped dead. Behind him, Moira’s small figure was visible, her face pale in the reflected light.

“Jesus, Mary and Joseph,” Archie breathed. “What in the name of God…”

Donnie lowered the gun. He let it clatter to the floor. He pushed himself to his feet, every muscle protesting. “He’s here. A man. Carrington. He’s in the shadows.”

Archie immediately stepped in front of Moira, his big body becoming a shield. He swept his torch beam around. “Show yourself, ya bampot!”

Only silence answered.

Moira peered around Archie. “We saw a black car. Two men. They were… professional. They went in the front. We came round the back, saw the broken window.” She hugged herself. “I called the police. They said they’d send someone.”

The police. Donnie almost laughed. It would be too late. Or it would be the wrong kind of police.

“We need to go,” Donnie said. “Now.”

“The tapes?” Moira asked.

“Gone.”

He didn’t elaborate. He started moving towards them, towards Archie’s light, leaving the gun on the floor, leaving Carrington in the darkness. As he passed the spot where he’d dropped the business card, he didn’t look down. He kept walking.

They hurried back the way Archie and Moira had come, through a side door that was propped open with a brick, out into a loading bay. The night air was a shock, cold and clean after the tomb-damp of the warehouse. The rain had stopped, leaving the cobbles slick and shining under a bruised sky.

Archie’s van was parked crookedly on a patch of waste ground, looking like a battered, familiar friend. They piled in, Archie behind the wheel, Donnie in the passenger seat, Moira in the back, still trembling.

“Start talking,” Archie growled, firing up the engine. “From the beginning.”

As Archie pulled the van out onto the empty, neon-stained street, Donnie talked. He told them about the tunnel, the locker, the tapes, the card. He told them about Carrington, the waiting, the offer, the fight. He left out what was on the tapes. He didn’t know, and that, he realised, was now his only protection. And theirs.

Moira listened, her face grave. “The name on the card, Donnie. What was it?”

Donnie looked out the window at the sleeping city. The tenements were dark cliffs. A lone taxi cruised, a yellow beetle. The local universal. His city. The stage for this secret, stupid war.

“I didn’t get a good look,” he lied, his voice flat. “It fell. It’s gone.”

Archie shot him a look. He knew a lie when he heard one. But he didn’t challenge it. He gripped the wheel tighter. “So what now? They know who you are. They know where you drink. They’ll be back.”

“Aye,” Donnie said. The seed of the resolution, planted in the darkest moment, was a bitter, hard little thing in his gut. Carrington needed it to be voluntary. He needed the chain intact. He needed Donnie to be a willing errand boy or a silent stone. He couldn’t have a loose end who had thrown the package into the dark and kept the name in his head.

“We need to listen to the tapes,” Moira said, leaning forward. “We need to know what Margaret died for.”

“No,” Donnie said, turning to look at her. Her eyes were wide, earnest behind her glasses. “That’s what he wants. That’s what makes you a target. You stay ignorant. You stay out of it.”

“But you *know* the name,” she insisted.

“And that’s my problem. Not yours.” He faced front again. “Archie, take me home.”

“Home? They’ll be waiting!”

“Maybe. But I need to think. And I need to be somewhere he expects me to be.”

It made a perverse sense. The fortress of the expected. The Gallowgate. His close. His own front door. It was the last place they’d look for a man planning a counter-move, because no one planned anything from a one-bedroom flat in the Gallowgate.

Archie swore under his breath but changed direction, heading east, towards the river, towards the tall, grim shadow of Donnie’s tenement.

When the van pulled up on the deserted street, the close mouth was a black yawn.

“You’re not going up there alone,” Archie stated.

“I am. You take Moira. You go to your sister’s in Cumbernauld. You stay there. You don’t answer the phone. You don’t come back until you hear from me.”

“Donnie—”

“That’s the job, Archie,” Donnie said, and his voice held the finality of the graveyard. “You got me into this. You see her safe out of it. That’s your penance.”

Archie’s jaw worked. He gave a single, sharp nod.

Donnie got out. He didn’t look back. He walked into the close. The familiar smell of damp and disinfectant and old cooking greeted him. He climbed the stairs, his footsteps echoing in the stone well. His body ached from the fight, a dull, spreading pain.

His door was on the latch. He always left it on the latch. He pushed it open.

The light was on in the living room.

He stopped in the tiny hallway, his heart a cold fist in his chest.

Sitting in his armchair, the one that faced the window overlooking the street, was a man. He was older than Carrington, with a lean, weathered face and hair the colour of iron filings. He wore a good, but old, wool coat. He held a mug of tea. Donnie’s mug.

The man turned his head. His eyes were a pale, watery blue, but they held a sharp, assessing light. He didn’t smile.

“Donald,” the man said. His voice was Glasgow, but a certain kind of Glasgow. Kelvinside, softened by years elsewhere. “I made myself a brew. I hope you don’t mind.”

Donnie stood frozen. The net. It was here. In his home.

“Who are you?”

The man took a sip of tea. He placed the mug carefully on the arm of the chair. He stood up. He was tall, and he moved with a stiff, deliberate grace.

“My name,” he said, “is Alistair Matheson.”

The name from the card. The final piece. Here, in the flesh, drinking tea in Donnie’s living room.

“Margaret didn’t send you to deliver the tapes to me, son,” Matheson said, his gaze steady, mournful. “She sent you to find me. To show me what she’d done. To ask me the question she couldn’t ask thirty years ago.” He took a step forward. “The question is: was it worth it?”

He gestured to the table. Lying there, side by side, were the ten small cassettes, neatly arranged. And next to them, the plastic bag, folded.

Carrington hadn’t retrieved them. Donnie hadn’t thrown them far enough. Matheson had been in the warehouse too. He’d been watching the whole time.

The game hadn’t changed. It had just revealed its true player. And he was standing in Donnie’s living room, between Donnie and the door, between Donnie and any hope of being a stone. The transaction wasn’t over. It was just beginning. And the price was no longer Donnie’s life, or the tapes.

It was the answer to a dead woman’s question.

# Chapter 24

## **CHAPTER 24**

The rain on the Gallowgate wasn’t water, it was a greasy smear. It fell in a slant, needling the hunched shoulders of the tenements, turning the granite from proud grey to a weeping black. Donnie McCallum watched it from the window of his own living room, a man he didn’t know standing between him and the door. The condensation on the glass ran in slow, dirty tears. Outside, a streetlight flickered, casting a jaundiced glow on the wet pavement. A young man in a hoodie, shoulders up around his ears against the downpour, hurried past, a ghost from a different life. Donnie knew the move. A futile, instinctive armour. He’d perfected it himself. He wasn’t wearing it now. The cold was inside.

Alistair Matheson stood by the armchair, a monument in a worn wool coat. He didn’t block the door, not physically. He just was the door. The only exit from this moment. His pale eyes held Donnie in place more effectively than any lock.

“Was it worth it?” Donnie repeated, the words ash in his mouth.

“That’s the question she left for me,” Matheson said. His voice was quiet, the Kelvinside accent sanded down by time and distance, but the Glasgow bedrock was still there, a hard stratum beneath the polish. “She couldn’t ask it when it mattered. So she built a mechanism. A clockwork mouse. You.”

Donnie’s eyes flicked to the table. The ten cassettes, lined up like little headstones. The plastic bag beside them, a shroud. Carrington had been a terrier, snapping at his heels. Matheson was the gamekeeper. He’d been in the blind the whole time, watching the dog work.

“You were in the warehouse.”

“I was ensuring Mr. Carrington didn’t get over-enthusiastic. He’s a blunt instrument. Useful, but prone to breaking the thing he’s meant to retrieve.” Matheson’s gaze didn’t waver. “Margaret’s tapes. Her confession. Her… accusation. She wanted them to find me. Only me. She knew Carrington’s lot would intercept any direct approach. So she used a circuitous route. A lost cause. You.”

The words should have stung. They just settled, a confirmation of a truth he’d tasted since he first lifted that shoebox from the locker. He’d never been the solver. He’d been the envelope. The delivery mechanism.

“Why not just post them?”

“Because I would have burned them unplayed,” Matheson said, simple as stating the time. “A package from a dead woman I’d wronged? Sentiment is a luxury. Operational security is a discipline. But a man… a man appearing out of the shadows, chased by my own people, with her voice on his person? That’s a message that demands an audience. She knew my curiosity would outweigh my caution. She knew I’d have to look the messenger in the eye.”

He took a step closer. Not a threat, an adjustment. The room was small. His presence filled it.

“She told you the story,” Matheson said. It wasn’t a question. “The bright young things. The idealism. The compromise. The one big, beautiful lie that built a hundred smaller, uglier ones.”

“She said you made a choice,” Donnie said. His own voice sounded strange to him, detached. “To protect the future. By betraying the present.”

Matheson’s lips thinned, something like a smile but with no warmth in it. “A neat formulation. She was always better with words. With the moral calculus. I was better with the maps. With the consequences drawn in red ink.” He gestured to the tapes. “She recorded those to absolve herself. To lay the sin at my door. But the sin was ours, Donald. The choice was ours. She just couldn’t live with the arithmetic afterwards.”

“And you could?”

For the first time, Matheson looked away. His eyes found the rain-streaked window, the bleak Glasgow night. “I lived. That’s different. I built a life on the foundation of that choice. A career. A sense of… order. She built a shrine to her guilt. We both had our prisons.”

He turned back. The sharp, assessing light was in his eyes again. “But you’re not here for a philosophical debate. You’re here because she sent you to ask the question. And because I am here to answer it. But an answer requires context. You’ve heard her testimony. You deserve to hear the… defence.”

Matheson moved to the armchair again, but he didn’t sit. He stood behind it, his hands resting on the worn fabric, a speaker at a lectern. “The year was 1974. The Cold War wasn’t a metaphor. It was a physical fact, a wall through a city, a line on a map that was a tripwire for annihilation. Our side, their side. A simple story. But Glasgow… Glasgow was a complication.”

He paused, gathering the past like papers on a desk.

“The shipyards were bleeding out. The steelworks were coughing their last. The old industries that built this city and its people were being dismantled. And in that vacuum, Donald, what grows? Despair. And despair is a fertile ground for ideology. Not our tidy, parliamentary socialism. The hard stuff. The kind that looked east and saw not an enemy, but a patron. A alternative. There were men here, serious men, trade unionists, councillors, thinkers… who were starting to believe the future lay not in Westminster, but in Moscow. That the only way to save the working man was to break the state entirely.”

Donnie saw it. Not the grand espionage of films, but the grubby reality of it. Meetings in back rooms of pubs like the *Clansman*. Pamphlets printed on stolen paper. A slow, deliberate turning of the ship.

“Our job,” Matheson continued, “was to monitor. To understand. To contain. But containment is a gentle word for what was needed. This wasn’t a debating society. It was a slow-motion coup. The funding was traceable, the connections clear. They were being groomed. And if they succeeded, if they turned this city—this *engine* of Britain—into a Soviet client state in all but name… the response from London would not be gentle. It would be brutal. A suppression. Troops in the streets. A wound this city would never recover from.”

The rain tapped its fingers on the glass. The streetlight finally gave up its struggle and died, plunging the room into deeper gloom, lit only by the single bulb from the hallway. Matheson’s face was half in shadow.

“We had a source. Deep within their circle. A man who believed he was playing a double game. He gave us everything. Names, plans, timetables. The whole architecture. And we saw our moment. We could roll it up. Arrest the lot. A show trial, headlines, the whole ugly spectacle. It would have been a pyre, Donald. A pyre on which the legitimate grievances of this city would have been burned as treason. It would have created martyrs. It would have poisoned the well for fifty years.”

He lifted a hand, let it fall back to the chair.

“Or. We could use the architecture. We could feed the source different information. A smaller list. A list of the most committed, the most dangerous. And we could arrange for them to be… discredited. Not by us. By their own. A financial scandal. A personal disgrace. Information leaked to the wrong people. Not a pyre. A quiet, surgical removal of the rot, while leaving the body—the city—intact. The wider movement, confused and leaderless, would fracture. It would remain a protest, not a revolution.”

“The one big, beautiful lie,” Donnie said, the phrase from Margaret’s tape clicking into place.

“The lie was the source,” Matheson said, his voice flat. “He wasn’t one of theirs playing at being ours. He was ours, from the start. A plant. We built their movement a hero, and we let them trust him. The information he gave them was real—enough to build their dreams on. The information he gave us was their doom. The list of men to be removed… he provided it. He named his own friends. His comrades. He condemned them to ruin. To keep the peace. To save the city from a worse fate.”

The room was silent save for the rain. Donnie saw it. The moral swamp. You didn’t betray the enemy. You betrayed the idealistic, the passionate, the misguided. You let them trust you, and you used that trust to break them. You did it for the greater good. You did it so soldiers wouldn’t march down the Saltmarket.

“Margaret was the courier,” Donnie said.

“She was the conscience,” Matheson corrected. “She believed in the ends. She facilitated the means. But she had to look at the faces. She was the one who passed the envelopes in cafes, who saw the light in their eyes when they greeted their ‘trusted’ comrade. She was the one who later saw those same faces on the front pages, shamed, broken, their lives in tatters. She carried the names. I carried the strategy. The source… he carried the sin. And he couldn’t carry it.”

“Frank.”

Matheson nodded, once. “Frank Burgess. Our man. The perfect believer. He believed so completely he convinced everyone, himself most of all. Until he had to enact the final phase. The betrayal. It broke him. Not immediately. It seeped into him, slow and toxic. The guilt. He started to talk. To Margaret. He wanted absolution. He wanted the story told. He was becoming a liability. A danger to the peace we’d supposedly bought.”

“So you had him killed.”

The words hung in the damp air. Matheson didn’t flinch.

“His death was ruled a suicide. A fall from the Finnieston Crane. It was… tidy. It preserved the narrative. It closed the circle.”

“Margaret knew.”

“She suspected. I never confirmed it. But she knew the logic of the world we operated in. The final, cold equation. One life against the stability we’d crafted. After that, she was gone. Not physically. But her faith was. She resigned. She buried herself here. And she began her own project. The tapes. Her testament. She waited until she was dying to set her clockwork in motion. To force me to look at the arithmetic, thirty years on.”

He pushed away from the chair now, standing fully in the dim light. The moment of recollection was over. The present was back, heavy and immediate.

“So,” Matheson said. “The question. Was it worth it?”

He didn’t wait for Donnie to speak. He answered himself, his eyes on the cassettes.

“The violent revolution in Glasgow never happened. The troops never flooded the East End. The city declined, yes. It suffered. But it wasn’t shattered by civil strife or military repression. The men on that list… their lives were ruined. Their families shamed. Frank Burgess is a suicide in a police file. Margaret Ainslie lived a life of quiet despair. I lived a life of quiet justification.” He finally looked at Donnie. “That is the ledger. You tell me. You’ve been chased, shot at, manipulated. You’ve seen the cost up close. You’ve heard her voice. You stand in the ruins of the peace we bought. Was it worth it?”

Donnie felt the weight of it. The immense, bloody calculus of statecraft. It was a question for history, for philosophers. Not for a man standing in his own living room with wet socks. He wasn’t a judge. He was a stone that had been kicked, and had started an avalanche he couldn’t comprehend.

But he had to speak. He was the question’s vessel.

“No,” Donnie said, the word leaving him like a breath he’d been holding for days. It wasn’t a shout. It was flat. Final. “It was just a different kind of breaking.”

Matheson absorbed this. He gave a slow, almost imperceptible nod. Not of agreement, but of acknowledgment.

“That,” he said, “is Margaret’s answer. The one she couldn’t give herself. She needed a proxy. A voice from outside the garden walls.” He moved then, not towards Donnie, but towards the table. He looked down at the tapes. “The transaction, as you put it to Carrington, is complete. The merchandise is delivered. The question is asked and answered.”

He reached into his coat pocket. Donnie tensed, his body coiling. But Matheson didn’t pull a gun. He pulled out a small, sleek device. A digital recorder. He placed it on the table next to the cassettes.

“What’s that?”

“My side of the story,” Matheson said. “The unvarnished operational account. Names, dates, methods. The truth, as I know it. It doesn’t justify. It explains.” He looked at Donnie. “Margaret’s tapes are an emotional truth. Mine is a clinical one. Together… they are the whole, ugly picture.”

“Why give it to me?”

“Because you are the mechanism,” Matheson said, as if it were obvious. “The job is not finished. You have delivered her question to me. Now you must deliver the answer—the full answer—to the world.”

Donnie stared at him. “The world? You think I’m going to the papers? To the police? Your lot would bury me. Carrington would…”

“Carrington,” Matheson interrupted, his voice gaining an edge of cold steel, “is no longer your concern. He was operating on old mandates, chasing ghosts. He has been… recalled. The file is being sealed. Permanently. The people we served have no desire for this history to be opened. They want it to remain a suicide, a dead woman’s ramblings, a lost courier’s fantasy. They want you to be a stone that sank without a ripple.”

He picked up the plastic bag. He carefully slotted the ten cassettes and his own digital recorder inside. He folded the top over, neatly. He held it out to Donnie.

“This is your ripple, Donald. This is the stone, refusing to sink.”

Donnie didn’t take it. “They’ll kill me.”

“They won’t,” Matheson said. “Because if they touch you, if you have an ‘accident,’ the contents of this bag become the only story. I have taken precautions. Copies exist in places that will activate upon my death… or yours. The only way for them to win is for this story to remain unheard, and for you to remain a quiet, living man. You are now, ironically, under the protection of the very truth they want buried. Your safety is their silence.”

It was the ultimate, perverse transaction. His life for their secret. His silence for his survival.

“And you?” Donnie asked. “Where do you go?”

Matheson’s smile was a ghost of a thing. “I go to live with the answer you gave. The one I knew was coming. The one I’ve been waiting thirty years to hear from someone who wasn’t in the garden.” He placed the bag on the table, midway between them. “The choice is yours. You can burn it. You can throw it in the Clyde. You can go back to being a stone. A quiet man in a quiet flat, with a story no one would believe. You’ve earned that peace. It’s the peace we bought, after all.”

He walked towards the door. Donnie didn’t move. Matheson paused in the hallway, his frame outlined by the weak light.

“Or,” Matheson said, not looking back, “you can be the messenger one last time. You can let the dead speak. You can make the cost mean something. Not a strategic victory. Not a historical footnote. A warning. A testament. You can make sure the breaking wasn’t just for nothing.”

He opened the door. The sound of the rain grew louder, a steady hiss on the street.

“Goodbye, Donald.”

The door closed softly behind him.

Donnie stood alone in his living room. The space where Matheson had been felt charged, empty and full at once. The bag sat on the table. A shoebox for a new era.

He walked over to the window. The rain was still the same greasy smear. The tenements still hunched against it. Down below, the street was empty. No watchers. No Carrington. No Matheson. Just the glistening cobbles and the orange halo of the working streetlights.

He thought of Margaret Ainslie, recording her guilt in a silent room. He thought of Frank Burgess, climbing the crane in the dark. He thought of the men whose lives were turned to ash to save a city from fire. He thought of Archie, of the *Clansman*, of a pint of heavy sitting untouched. A life of small, manageable truths.

The net wasn’t just gone. It had dissolved. He was free. He was more trapped than ever.

He turned from the window. His eyes found the bag.

He was not a judge. He was not a philosopher. He was a courier.

The job wasn’t finished.

He walked to the table. He didn’t pick up the bag. Not yet. He went to the kitchenette, filled the kettle, plugged it in. The mundane ritual. The click of the switch was loud in the silence. He got out his mug—the one Matheson had used—and rinsed it under the tap, watching the water swirl. He made a brew. Tea bag, water, a splash of milk. He carried it back to the living room and sat in his armchair, the one that faced the window.

He sat there for a long time, watching the rain, drinking his tea. Letting the cold fist in his chest slowly unclench. Letting the scale of it all settle into something he could carry.

When the mug was empty, he placed it on the floor.

He stood up. He went to the table. He picked up the plastic bag. It was heavier than it looked.

He had no grand plan. No newspaper in mind. No righteous fury. Just a simple, dogged understanding. A message had been entrusted. It had to be delivered. Not to one man in a shadowy room. To the light.

He took his jacket from the hook. He shrugged it on. He put the plastic bag into the deep inside pocket. It rested against his chest, a dull, solid weight.

He switched off the living room light. He walked out into the tiny hallway. He opened the front door.

The rain needled his face, cold and impersonal. He turned up his collar, a futile, instinctive armour against the elements. He’d perfected it himself, years ago.

He stepped out onto the Gallowgate. The pavement shone black under the streetlights. He turned right, without knowing why, and began to walk. The tenements watched him go, their windows dark eyes. The greasy smear of rain washed over everything, trying to erase the world.

But he was still here. And he was carrying something.

He walked, one foot in front of the other, a man with a destination he couldn’t name, a message in his pocket, and the whole long, wet night ahead of him. The stone had been kicked. Now it had to roll.
